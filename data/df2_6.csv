0,Amitabh Tiwari,"UP, Bihar Bypoll Results Analysis: Impact of By-Elections on National Politics","In a huge blow to the BJP just a year before the next Lok Sabha elections, the party has lost Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls to the SP-BSP duo in Uttar Pradesh. BJP also failed to wrest the Araria Lok Sabha seat in spite of all their big claims   a weakened RJD after Laluâ€™s jail term. What is more humiliating is the fact that both the seats in UP were represented by their top two men, the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, and the Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, and were both won by huge margins (3 lakh+). In UP,   (Mayawati) and   (Akhilesh) joined hands to take on the BJP, with BSP extending support to SP candidates. Both the parties ran a pilot project which could take the shape of a   in UP for 2019. BJP, which was leading in Gorakhpur by 1.36 lakh votes in 2014, after aggregating BSP and SP votes, lost the seat by 21,881 votes. In the Phulpur seat, BJP, which was leading by 1.44 lakh votes in 2014, still lost the seat by 59,613 votes. BSP has again proved its ability to transfer its votes to its alliance partners. The grand alliance has made a dent in the BJP's vote share: -5 percent in Gorakhpur and -13 percent in Phulpur, indicating the loss of a section of its anchor â€“ the OBC support base. Some Dalits who voted for BJP in 2014 appear to have gone back into the BSP fold. It has a dedicated set of voters in each constituency, which is its biggest strength. This victory may finally give shape to a SP-BSP grand alliance in which the Congress may also join. BJP won one-fourth (71) of its overall tally (282) from UP in 2014. Any loss of seats in UP will directly affect BJPâ€™s ability to cross the halfway mark in Lok Sabha in 2019 and also Modiâ€™s chances to return as Prime Minister even if BJP emerges as the single largest party. The fact that the alliance partners BSP and SP were able to transfer their votes seamlessly will pose greater difficulties for the BJP. The social coalition of Dalits, Adivasis, Yadavs and Muslims, (51 percent of the population) which this grand alliance hopes to create, would pose a significant challenge to the upper caste, Jat and OBC vote block of BJP (49 percent of the population). In Bihar, the RJD and Congress alliance have held onto the Araria Lok Sabha seat (by 61,988 votes) and Jehanabad (by 35,036 votes) assembly seat despite the RJD party patriarch Lalu being in jail. While Jehanabad is a minority-dominated seat, BJP was hopeful of winning the Araria Lok Sabha seat (15 percent Muslim voters) which it had won in alliance with JDU in 2004 and 2009. The results suggest Nitish has lost significant support among the minority community because of his re-entry into NDA. JDU lost 1/3rd of its votes to RJD. While the RJD candidate benefited from the â€˜sympathy factorâ€™ owing to his fatherâ€™s death, Lalu has been able to consolidate his vote base among the minorities, Yadavs and OBCs, alleging a â€˜witch huntâ€™ by the BJP as is evident from a 5 percent increase in vote share in Jehanabad. NDA won 31 out of 40 seats from this state and is the key to the partyâ€™s fortunes in 2019. BJPâ€™s loss in these bypolls gives a fillip to the efforts of the Opposition to form a broad anti-BJP alliance. Sonia Gandhi hosted a dinner for leaders of 20 regional parties yesterday at her residence to kickstart the process. These parties (excluding Left) together recorded 36 percent vote share in 2014, higher than the NDAâ€™s vote share of 34 percent (excluding TDP and Shiv Sena). BJPâ€™s consecutive wins, state after state, and its recent performance in Northeast has made regional parties jittery. In Karnataka, Congress is sweating it out against BJP to save one of its last big turfs. In Kerala, BJPâ€™s strategy is to up the ante against the communists, like in Tripura. Two of the top allies of the BJP â€“ Shiv Sena (18 seats) and TDP (15 seats) â€“ may contest independently. The entry of the JD(U) in NDA will complicate the seat-sharing arrangement in Bihar which could force smaller allies like LJP and RLSP to leave. Jitan Ram Manjhi has already left. The BJP cannot ignore these warning signals. It struggled in Gujarat. It has marketed its Northeast victory as historic, but the fact of the matter is that these three states have only five Lok Sabha seats. Big sections of society â€“ traders, farmers and youth â€“ are increasingly losing patience with the BJP. The fact that it rules 22 out of 31 states is a double-edged sword. It risks facing double anti-incumbency in these states. State leaders canâ€™t push blame to the Centre for non-performance, and similarly, Modi canâ€™t push blame on partyâ€™s/allyâ€™s state leadership for not delivering. To conclude, one year is a long enough time in politics. Everything was hunky-dory for the BJP till about a month ago. Two consecutive losses in its den have turned things upside down and thrown open the contest for 2019. Nothing is certain in politics. If the Opposition is able to overcome its differences and form a   at the national level, it could pose a serious challenge to Modi. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

1,The Quint,Jharkhand court convicts gau rakshaks in lynching-case,"A fast-track court in Jharkhand, on Wednesday, 21 March, sentenced 11 â€˜gau rakshaksâ€™ to life imprisonment for the murder of meat trader Alimuddin in Ramgarh on 29 June 2017. BJP district media in-charge Nityanand Mahto was among the 11 convicted persons. One of the 12 accused is a minor, said Additional Publci Prosecutor SK Shukla. According to PTI, the prosecution has asked the Juvenile Justice Board to treat the minor as an adult in this case. Judge Om Prakash found them guilty under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance) and 302 (murder), reported PTI. In June 2017, Alimuddin, alias Asgar Ansari, was lynched and his vehicle was set ablaze by a mob at Bazartand village near Ranchi. According to The Wire, the defence plans to appeal the conviction soon. According to  , accused Raj Kumar followed Ansari when he left the market 15 km away from Ramgarh at 7:30 am on 29 June. He kept the other accused informed about Ansariâ€™s movements for the next two hours. Ansariâ€™s vehicle was then halted at around 9:30 am near Bazar Tand, where he was attacked and his vehicle was gutted. More than a dozen people, including eight from the Bajrang Dal and local BJP unit, were arrested,   reported. Ansariâ€™s wife, Mariam Khatoon told the media that she was certain that â€œmurder was committed by â€œrogues owing allegiance toâ€ the Bajrang Dal, The Wire report added.

The speculation arose against the backdrop of the party's dismal performance in the Lok Sabha bypolls for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur seats. The two Lok Sabha seats had fallen vacant after the resignation of UP Chief Minister Yogi Aditynath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya. Previously, in 2017, Babbar had offered to resign after facing criticism for the partyâ€™s performance in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

3,Vivian Fernandes,Maharashtra Farmersâ€™ Protest: Farmers Call Off Protest as Government Accepts all Demands ,"A striking aspect of the â€˜Long Marchâ€™ of Maharashtraâ€™s farmers â€“ that began in Nashik on 6 March and ended in Mumbaiâ€™s Vidhan Sabha precincts on 12 March â€“ was their concern for their fellow citizens despite the hardship that had forced them to undertake the 180-km-long walk, enduring sore feet and hot sun. In September 2016, farmers pouring into Bengaluru from Kolar and Chikkaballapur broke police barricades and caused a lot of damage. The last leg of the Maharashtra farmersâ€™ journey in Mumbai towards the Vidhan Sabha was covered on the night of 12 March, as the farmers were keen not to inconvenience students taking the Secondary School Certificate examinations the next day. â€œWe felt they were our childrenâ€, said Ashok Dhawale, a doctor and the president of the Communist Party of India- Marxistâ€™s All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), which organised the march. Sensing the mood, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis readily conceded to their demand for the extension of loan waiver, and quick implementation of the Forest Right Act, 2006, which gives tribal farmers title to a maximum of ten acres of land they have been cultivating. This time the stateâ€™s Chief Secretary gave them an assurance in writing, which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly. â€œIt is part of the record of the proceedingsâ€, Dhawale said. The decision to undertake the march was taken at a meeting of the AIKS at Sangli on 16 February. For the next 15 days, a campaign was launched to register farmers. At any given time, there were 25,000 marchers, Dhawale said. The numbers swelled along the way and almost doubled in Mumbai. Most of the marchers were from Nashik. They also came from Palghar, Ahmednagar, Pune, Thane and Nandurbar. The cooks would set out early in the morning and reach the designated halts by about 8 am. The food would be ready by the time the marchers arrived at noon. About 15-20 km would be covered in the morning and the same distance after lunch. The marchers relieved themselves along the roads, except in Thane and Mumbai, where arrangements had been made with municipal corporations for mobile toilets. Unlike Kirori Singh Bainsla, leader of Rajasthanâ€™s Gurjar agitation, Gujaratâ€™s Patidar leader Hardik Patel, the stateâ€™s Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani, or those of the Karni Sena protesting the release of the film â€˜ â€™, Dhawale was not conspicuously visible. But he has a record of activism. Hailing from a family of medical doctors, Dhawale, who is based in Thane, cut his political teeth in the Students Federation of India while studying medicine in Mumbai, and doing his MA in Political Science from Mumbai University. He joined the AIKS in 1993, inspired by Godavari Parulekar, who led the pre-Independence Warli Adivasi revolt. In 2017, Dhawale became the president of AIKS. A year of plenty saw the price of pulses slump. Cotton has been damaged extensively by the pink bollworm. In June 2017, the stateâ€™s farmers agitated for 11 days. They refrained from selling milk, vegetables and fruits to cities, resulting in the state announcing a loan waiver. In March 2016, thousands of tribal farmers sat-in at the Nashik Collectorate to press for their demands. In October 2016, they laid siege to the Adivasi Development Ministerâ€™s residence in Palghar. Dhawale admits that loan waivers will provide only temporary relief. The solution to agrarian distress, in his view, is the â€œcomplete abandonment of neo-liberal policies followed since 1992â€. These policies, he says, have led to four lakh farmers committing suicide â€“ 70,000 of them in Maharashtra alone. But open trade actually helped Indian farmers during the global commodity boom of the last decade. It is only after 2013, when commodity prices slumped that farmers have suffered. Domestic policies that privilege the interests of urban consumers over those of farmers must be blamed too. When prices rise, the government shuts the door on exports to quell prices, but when they slump, it does not provide price support. Farmers suffer on both counts. The Maharashtra government told the agitators that the Centre has made a commitment to procure cereals, pulses and oil seeds at cost plus 50 percent. By â€œcostâ€ Dhawale means all cash expenses incurred in production, the imputed family labour cost and also the rental value of land. But economist Ashok Gulati has shown that this will raise the minimum support price of groundnut, soyabean and maize by 40 percent. If procured at those prices, they will have to be sold at a loss. This is the best insurance against crop failure. Large river-linking projects, which the government proposes, will be disruptive. The AIKS has given a proposal for small dams and lift irrigation. Construction of wells on a large scale, harnessing of rain water and micro-irrigation for frugal use of scare water might be better solutions. Farmers also need to be provided with seeds that are resilient, that is, those that can survive long dry spells, or resist pest and disease attacks. The most promising technology is genetic modification, but both the communists and the BJP government are opposed to it, even though farmers are adopting these technologies clandestinely. Tribal farmers need to be given land titles quickly. Dhawale says thousands of applications have been rejected, and even when accepted, titles are given for half-an-acre or one acre. He attributes this to the callousness of officials and the apathy of government leaders. He says the government will be held to its promises this time, and its action will be monitored. Most tribal farmers do subsistence farming. They grow rice and ragi (finger millet) for a part of the year, and migrate to cities for jobs. Till conditions are created for profitable agriculture, giving them a monthly relief cheque, to relieve distress might be a better option. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

4,The Quint,Kolkata News Today: QKolkata: Mamata Bans Display Of Arms On Ram Navami & More,"Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has asked police to prevent display of arms during Ram Navami processions on 25 March. All police stations in Bengal have also been told to be on alert during the rallies. Speaking at the administrative meeting in Hooghlyâ€™s Gurap on Tuesday, 20 March, Banerjee said: â€œI would ask police inspectors to keep a list of local clubs, NGOs, temples, mosques and churches in the area and keep in touch with them. I say this as part of community development to avert communal tension.â€ The CMâ€™s words came hours before BJP state president Dilip Ghosh announced that rallyists will continue with the tradition of carrying arms. â€œRallyists will carry arms as they do while taking out Ram Navami processions. I will also be there and carry a gada (mace) in one of the rallies,â€ Ghosh said at Howrah after a party meeting, days after RSSâ€™s Bengal unit announced that it wonâ€™t carry arms during Ram Navami rallies.

When the first cylinder ran out of oxygen near Dankuni, Sk Sarfarajuddin, the AC mechanic who posed as a doctor and accompanied the patient, said he did not know how to replace it. It was then left to ambulance driver Tara Babu Sha, who tried several times to fix the cylinder; but it did not work.

5,Abheek Barman,Passage of Finance Bill 2018-2019 Without Debate or Discussion Shows BJPâ€™s Anti-Democratic Mentality,"On 1 February, it took Finance Minister Arun Jaitley 108 minutes to read out his Budget proposals for 2018-19. Between sips of water, he described what taxes, cesses and surcharges youâ€™ll pay and how the government will spend that money, and then some, through 12 months beginning 1 April. Since 5 March, when Parliament started again, the Lok Sabha has been rocked by legislators demanding answers from the government on contentious issues like the Nirav Modi-Mehul Choksi scam that has shaken global confidence in our banks. Then on 14 March, the Parliament took exactly 30 minutes, less than 28 percent of the time Jaitley had spent on his speech, to approve of all taxation and spending proposals. Not one item about 21 tweaks to tax laws and hundreds of pages detailing  spending was debated by lawmakers directly elected to the Lower House of Parliament. This procedure of bulldozing complex legislation through the Lok Sabha is called the â€˜guillotine.â€™ It is named after the (erstwhile) â€˜favouriteâ€™ instrument of the French to â€˜enforce weight-lossâ€™ â€“ by cutting oneâ€™s head from the rest of the body. The lawmakersâ€™ guillotine, enforced by the Speaker, simply groups some or all of legislation into one bunch and gets it passed (in haste) by a voice vote. Since last year, finances of the Railways (Indiaâ€™s biggest employer and a big spender) have been part of the general Budget. Itâ€™s where finances also chugged into the guillotine. So, in supposedly the worldâ€™s largest democracy, the government has unilaterally decided to spend nearly Rs 90 lakh crore without a word of explanation or discussion. The Opposition, naturally, calls this the â€œmurder of democracy.â€ In some ways, it is correct. The Budget is a â€˜money billâ€™ which involves government finances. It does not need to be cleared by the Rajya Sabha, where the ruling BJP lacks a majority, nor can the President withhold approval for more than a fortnight. In the earlier instance, the newly-elected UPA-I government had a fig leaf: the Budget Session had very little time. This year, even that excuse does not hold â€“ there are three more weeks left in this session. There are three possible explanations, none of which contradicts the other, to explain this behaviour. Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, otherwise called â€˜Gurujiâ€™, was the most influential leader and theorist of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the parent of todayâ€™s BJP. Golwalkar led the RSS from 1940 to the 1970s. He had no time for the â€˜messy businessâ€™ called democracy. Sometime in the 1950s, he wrote: â€œThe Rajasuya and the Ashwamedha Yagnas had but one chief motive and that was to bring the whole of Bharat under the supreme political authority of a single Chakravarti.â€ Of course, when political authority stems from the sacrifice of a horse, minor things like the Constitution could be scrapped or re-written. Despite these foundational beliefs, todayâ€™s BJP is forced to lobby for votes, appeal to different kinds of Indians, peddle different promises to different constituents. But every time it gets a chance to subvert democracy, like shoving a Rs 90 lakh-crore Budget down the Parliamentâ€™s gullet in 30 minutes, it jumps at it. The mythical horse of   might not be at hand, but at least thereâ€™s a parliamentary guillotine to seek consolation in.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

6,TS Sudhir,Siddaramaiah Ups Ante With â€˜Lingayat Moveâ€™ Amid BJP Threat to Cong - The Quint,"Those in the Karnataka Congress call it an acknowledgement of a decades-old demand to accord a separate religion status to Lingayats. Those in the BJP dub Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's move as a naked ploy to divide the Hindus and play vote bank politics. Though this decision has been seen mainly through the political prism, there is a complex religious angle to it as well. At the heart of this controversy is the Lingayat vs Veerashaiva dispute. Lingayats are classified as OBCs in Karnataka and follow the teachings of Basaveshwara, a 12th century social reformer. Basavanna, as he is popularly called, fought against the inequalities in the Hindu social order by establishing a different religious stream. Veerashaivism on the other hand, is an order of the Shaiva faith, with Lord Shiva as the presiding deity. Basavanna's spiritual and reformist ideas attracted many people from across the country and that included some Shaivite brahmins from present-day Andhra Pradesh. Over centuries, the practice of Shaivism got mixed up with Basavanna-established Lingayatism. The Veerashaivas however, prayed in temples and believed in idol worship. In effect, Basavanna and fellow Lingayats rebelled against Hindu religion. This is why there has been a demand among Lingayats to be recognised as a religion separate from Hinduism. The committee incidentally also gave religious minority status under the Karnataka State Minorities Act to those Veerashaivas who have faith in Basavanna's philosophy. This will mean most of the Lingayat-Veerashaiva community will be out of Hindu religion, barring those Veerashaivas who believe in Hindu rituals. But it gained momentum only during the 2011 census, when a few Lingayat organisations campaigned to tell fellow community members not to register themselves as Hindus. More recently, a Lingayat gathering in Bidar in July last year pressed the demand for a separate religious identity. While Water Resources Minister MB Patil and Higher Education Minister Basavaraj Rayaredy, both Lingayats, favored accepting the committee report, Municipal Administration Minister Eshwar Khandre and Horticulture Minister SS Mallikarjun â€“ both Veerashaivas â€“ opposed the move. On the ground, the Congress is seen as dividing the Hindu community. Even the religious seers were seen in two different camps â€“ some for, others against. By Monday evening, clashes between Lingayats and Veerashaivas were reported from Kalburgi district in north Karnataka. There is a reason why a majority in the ruling party was in favour of according religious minority status to Lingayats. The community, with a population between 10 and 17 percent (according to two different Census) has traditionally favoured the BJP, motivated to a large extent by the presence of BS Yeddyurappa, the tallest Lingayat leader in Karnataka. Yeddyurappa says that both Lingayats and Veerashaivas belong to the same Hindu community. The politically and economically powerful community has the potential and the influence to decide the election in about one hundred of the 224 assembly constituencies, most of them in the northern part of Karnataka. One in every four MLAs in the present Karnataka assembly is a Veerashaiva or a Lingayat. The lure of a separate religion status also has a financial angle to it. A minority religion status will confer financial advantages in the form of tax waivers, upon educational institutions run by Lingayat owners. For Lingayat students and youths, it would mean reservations in the future in jobs and educational institutions. Now if the Centre sits on it, Siddaramaiah during the election campaign can blame the BJP for denying Lingayats their due. It says the Congress has taken the decision even when there was no mass uprising making the demand. What adds to the BJP's worries is that in 2013, Yeddyurappa was one of the signatories among several Lingayat politicians to a petition to the Centre asking for the community to be counted as a separate religion in the Census. On Monday, Congress flagged Yeddyurappa's signature as proof of his doublespeak over social media platforms. With the BJP's aggressive brand of Hindutva and nationalism making it difficult for the Congress to take an open pro-Muslim line for fear of being branded a Muslim party, Siddaramaiah has hit back by creating a local religious-political idiom. This month, the BJP dubbed the CM as â€˜jihadiâ€™, thereby raising the Congress hackles. Siddaramaiah has hit back by exposing the fault lines within the BJP's traditional vote bank. The explosive move has the potential to completely backfire on Siddaramaiah or turn out to be a political masterstroke. The summer of 2018 will hold the answer.

7,The Quint,Sankara Mutt Banner Torn In Response to  Periyar Statue Vandalism? - The Quint,"In another â€˜tit-for-tatâ€™ incident, the banner of the Sankara mutt in Salem was torn on 20 March, and a light in their campus damaged, allegedly by members of the Dravida Vidudhalai Kazhagam (DVK).  The incident comes after a Periyar statue in Pudukkottai was vandalised in the wee hours of Tuesday. Salem police tell TNM that the act of vandalism was primarily due to the incident at Pudukkottai. But they do not discount the tension created by the Rama Rajya Rath Yatra either. The mutt is located at Maravaneri in Salem. Three members of the DVK were arrested by the Hastampatti police after the incident. Krishnan (38), organiser of the DVK in Salem district, Rajendran (37) who is DVK's Nangavalli Town President and his deputy Manoj (30) were arrested by the police. This is the latest in a series of incidents kicked off by the remarks made by BJP national secretary H Raja on his verified Facebook account, following the razing of the Lenin statue in Tripura earlier this month. While H Raja subsequently deleted the post, and claimed it was made by an admin without his permission, the remark had already set off a chain of vandalism in the state. Hours after the post was put up, a Periyar statue was vandalised in Vellore, and in retaliation, several petrol bombs were thrown at the BJP office in Coimbatore. The vandalised Periyar statue was discovered in Pudukkottai in the wee hours of Tuesday even as TN braced itself for the Rama Rajya Ratha Yatra amidst much opposition. The Periyar statue was eight feet tall and made of cement. It was inaugurated of P Veeramani of the Dravidar Kazhagam in 2013. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

11,Praveen Swami,"Pak May Fuel Indian Jihad, But India Has its Own History of Terror - The Quint","Muhammad Taufiq had just been born when the searing winds of history scorched his world, and began driving him towards his death. He recorded those events in a low voice, inflected with the rolling consonants of the Deccan. He began: His face masked with a white handkerchief, an assault rifle cradled in his lap, and wearing the combat fatigues in which he would be buried, Taufiqâ€™s appeared an al Qaeda video on 6 December to deliver his only testament. â€œLands in which Islam once reigned are now ruled by [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi and his stooges,â€ he went on. He concluded: Killed in a Jammu and Kashmir Police-led assault on 12 March, three months after the video was released, Taufiqâ€™s story sheds light on the sunrise of a new jihad: one linking the growing ranks of young Islamists inspired by al Qaeda and the Islamic State with jihadist groups in Kashmir. Led by Mohammed Iliyas Yazdani, a 24 year-old college dropout, the cell is alleged to have have been in touch with Muhammad Shafi Armar â€“ an Indian Mujahideen fugitive who made his way to Pakistan in 2008 before travelling to Syriaâ€™s war-torn Raqqa. Efforts to tie together the jihad in Jammu and Kashmir with the larger Islamist project against the Indian state, date back over a decade â€” but failed. Now, the resurgent power of terrorism in Kashmir, coupled with the sharpening of communal strains across the country, has given this project a second chance. Figures like Taufiq hope to be the medium for this message. Born in the coal-mining town of Manuguru in 1994 â€“ the year after a Hindu nationalist movement demolished the Babri Masjid â€“ there seems to have been little to distinguish Taufiqâ€™s life from that of millions of others. His father works at the Department of Atomic Energyâ€™s heavy water plant in the town, a key part of Indiaâ€™s nuclear programme. Like his two other sons, Taufiqâ€™s father is not believed to have any connections to either Islamist political groups or jihadist terrorism, police sources say. Before he disappeared from Telengana in October 2017, police sources said, Taufiq was twice counselled by officers concerned by his trawling jihadist websites. But with no evidence that Taufiq was plotting actual operations, and multiple active plots that stretched the policeâ€™s resources, he was not kept under active surveillance. In 2016, the Islamic State released a video featuring several Indian operatives. The men included Hyderabad resident Talmeez-ur-Rahman, who abandoned his studies at a university in Texas before travelling to Syria. The police in Kashmir believe Taufiq visited Kashmir at least once before 2017, where he met with the two terrorists killed alongside him â€” schoolteacherâ€™s son Isa Fazili, and Syed Owais Shah, who had just completed an engineering degree. For us to attribute Taufiqâ€™s story to the toxic effects of online jihadi propaganda would be easy â€“ too easy. In search of a deeper explanation of what happened and why, we must examine the stories of men who travelled before him to train in Kashmir. These stories are, in turn, just a part of Indiaâ€™s centuries-old jihadist tradition. Like all good stories, this one began a long time ago, in a land far away.   Cheraman Perumal Bhaskara Ravi Varma, the legend goes, saw the moon divide in two, as he lounged on the rooftop of his place in Keralaâ€™s Kodungallore one night. In the desert of the Hijaz that same night, the same split moon shone on either side of the mountain of al-Nur, a sign to the pagans of Mecca that the Prophet Muhammad was indeed the messenger of god. Cheraman Perumal learned of the meaning of the miracle he had seen, travelled to Arabia, and was converted by the Prophet himself â€“ to whom, the legend has it, he presented a bottle of pickle. The Cheraman Jama Masjid, reputed to be over 1,370 years old, still stands â€“ facing east, in the Hindu tradition. In 2008, Tadiyantavide Nasir, wanted for the Indian Mujahideenâ€™s bombing of Bengaluru, found work as an instructor at the Noorishahâ€™s Hyderabad centre. He succeeded in setting up a secret jihadist circle within its ranks. The group recruited several men to train with the Lashkar-e-Taiba in Kashmirâ€™s Kupwara mountains. Nasir hoped these new recruits would form the core of a reborn Indian Mujahideen, capable of armed assaults on political leaders and police. Four of Nasirâ€™s recruits, though, were killed by Indian soldiers inside weeks of arriving Kupwara; 1973-born Abdul Jabbar, a fifth-grade school dropout who made a living as a cook at a roadside hotel, was the only survivor. Later arrested, Nasir, along with Jabbar and several others linked to the plan, received a life sentence. In the wake of these arrests, Indian Mujahideenâ€™s remnants in India, and the Kashmir experiment wasnâ€™t repeated â€“ until, that is, Taufiq travelled towards his death last autumn. To the end, Nasir refused to see himself as a terrorist. â€œDonâ€™t teach me about patriotism,â€ Nasir shouted after his conviction. â€œI am a descendant of the  , who fought foreign invaders.â€ From the 1450s on, as the Portuguese sought to take control of spice trade across the Indian ocean, Malabarâ€™s Muslim naval chiefs, or  , fought what the contemporary historian Zain-ad-Din Maâ€™abari described as a â€œjihad against the worshippers of the cross.â€ This jihad, though, was fought under the patronage of Cochinâ€™s Hindu king, the Zamorin. The Zamorin switched sides and backed the Portuguese in 1600, but   armed only with cutlasses staged suicide attacks on ships, soldiers and church congregations for another two centuries. In modern Kerala Muslim culture, these jihadists are venerated as protectors of the community against imperialist violence. For example, the story of   celebrates the martyrdom of a seaman who is killed while seeking to rescue a Muslim girl kidnapped by Portuguese sailors. His severed limbs are thrown into the sea, and each place they wash up at witnesses miracles. Elsewhere in India, there were also similar movements, chronicled by the historian Ayesha Jalal. The manifesto released by the Indian Mujahideen after bombing Delhi in 2008, notably, hailed the memory of Syed Ahmed Barelvi and Shah Ismail Dehlvi, who waged jihad to carve a shariâ€™a-governed state out of British Indiaâ€™s northwest. In the absence of credible political action against communalism, the jihadist narrative will continue to draw angry, disenfranchised men. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

13,PTI,Lingayat Issue: MHA to Examine Siddaramaiah Govtâ€™s Proposal - The Quint,"The Union Home Ministry will examine in detail the Karnataka government's recommendation to grant religious minority tag to the Lingayat and Veerashaiva Lingayat community as and when it receives the proposal, an official said on Tuesday, 21 March. The central government's reaction came a day after the Congress government in poll-bound Karnataka decided to recommend that religious minority tag be granted to the numerically strong and politically-influential Lingayat and Veerashaiva Lingayat community. The Home Ministry is expected to forward the proposal to the Registrar General & Census Commissioner for a detailed examination and suggestions, another official said. The Karnataka government took the decision following a recommendation of an expert panel set up by the state government on the issue. The demand for a separate religion tag to Veerashaiva/ Lingayat faiths has surfaced from the community, amidst resentment from within, over projecting the two communities as one. While one section led by Akhila Bharata Veerashaiva Mahasabha has demanded separate religion status, asserting that Veerashaiva and Lingayats are the same, the other group wanted it only for Lingayats. They believe that VeerashaivasÂ  are one among the seven sects of Shaivas, which is part of Hinduism. Karnataka State Minorities Commission had formed a seven-member committee, headed by retired high court Judge HN Nagamohan Das, on the issue which submitted its report on 2 March. The Lingayat/Veerashaiva community that owes allegiance to the ""social reform movement"" initiated by Basaveshwara has a substantial population in Karnataka, especially in the northern parts of the state. The BJP and several sections of the Hindu community have maintained a cautious stance, keeping away from the moveÂ  to give Veerashaiva/Lingayat separate religion status. They have accused the Siddaramaiah government of dividing the society to draw political mileage ahead of assembly elections due in the next couple of months.

15,Arun Dev,"Haunted By a Memorandum, Yeddyurappa Plays Safe on Lingayat Issue - The Quint","For almost 24 hours after the Karnataka government recommended the creation of the  , BS Yeddyurappa â€“ the BJPâ€™s chief ministerial candidate in the state and a Lingayat leader â€“ chose to not react. This was despite the BJP strongly opposing the state governmentâ€™s decision. Then appearing before the media on Tuesday morning, Yeddyurappa said he will stand by the decision of the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha (AIVM), an umbrella organisation of Veerashaivas and Lingayats in India. The announcement came as a surprise to many as the chairman of the Mahasabha, Shamanur Shivashankarappa, on Monday, had welcomed the governmentâ€™s decision. But within hours of Yeddyurappaâ€™s statement, Shivashankarappa called for a press conference and retracted his statement. He said the Mahasabhaâ€™s decision will be announced only after a meeting, and that he had prematurely supported the decision. Although his retraction is said be because of Yeddyurappaâ€™s intervention, the BJP state president has not directly criticised the government on this decision. Yeddyurappa was a signatory in the memorandum â€“ leaked in July 2017 â€“ sent to the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by the AIVM, seeking a religious status for the combined Veerashaiva-Lingayat community. The Lingayat community comprises two sub-sects â€“ Lingayats and Veerashaivas. Yeddyurappa is a Veerashaiva who has been projected as a leader of the unified Lingayat community by the BJP. He has, in the past, opposed the creation of separate, exclusive religion for Lingayats. However, he supported a religion tag for the unified Veerashaiva-Lingayat community â€“ separate from Hinduism. Yeddyurappa in the past had tried to change his stand, claiming Lingayats and Veerashaivas are Hindus, but the leaked memorandum document called his bluff. In the memorandum dated 25 July 2013, Shivashankarappa had asked for separate code, number, column and abbreviation to record the religion of the Veerashaiva-Lingayat community in the census form. The memorandum, carrying Yeddyurappaâ€™s signature, read: Adding to Yeddyurappaâ€™s woes, Shivashankarappa gave a statement supporting the governmentâ€™s decision on Monday. â€œWe accept the decision of the cabinet meeting headed by CM Siddaramaiah. He has made the decision to do justice to both Veerashaivas and Lingayats â€“ and this is acceptable to us,â€ he said. BJP sources told   that following this statement, Yeddyurappa had been in talks with the Mahasabha, asking them to reconsider their stand on the issue. Following which, on Tuesday, the AIVM chairman retracted his statement, and said that a decision on the issue will be taken after a meeting of the Mahasabha. However, Yeddyurappaâ€™s options to create political opposition to the decision are limited, as the governmentâ€™s proposal does not differentiate between Lingayats and Veerashaivas. In Karnataka state caste reservation list, Veerashaiva-Lingayat are classified under section 3B. Under this section, the community enjoys reservations up to 5 percent. When the new religion was announced by the government, this section 3B was used to identify who will be a part of the new religion, which effectively brought the entire community under the new religion. However, a clause was added that only those Veerashaivas who follow Basavanna will be a part of the new religion. The Veerashaivas who refuse to follow Basavanna and want to remain Hindus, could have been targeted by the BJP to raise an opposition. But, foreseeing this, the government said that the benefits enjoyed by those coming under section 3B will continue regardless of the new religion. This ensured that those opting out of the new religion will not lose their existing benefits. The lack of options to counter the Congress on the Lingayat issue has become a setback for Yeddyurappa and his fortunes in the upcoming Karnataka elections will depend heavily on how he can ensure his largest vote bank stays with him. Successfully convincing AIVM to oppose the governmentâ€™s decision can be a major boost for the BJP towards this goal. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

16,The Quint,Central Govt Should Focus More on the Needs of South: Pawan Kalyan - The Quint,"Amid controversy over the demand for a special category status for Andhra Pradesh, actor-politician and Janasena party president Pawan Kalyan said it is unfortunate that Union government does not pay attention to the needs of the southern states. Speaking to the editor-in-chief of The News Minute, Dhanya Rajendran, Kalyan accused the central government of stalling the growth of Andhra Pradesh, especially after bifurcation, and called on the political and media leadership in the country to pay special focus on the cultural assimilation of the northern and southern states. He said, â€œIf sub-region issues could separate a state, can you imagine the magnitude of disparity between south and north? Government should definitely focus more on the cultural assimilation.â€ Pawan, younger brother of superstar and Congress leader Chiranjeevi, also ruled out any dealings with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) till the state's demands are met. The actor had been targeting Andhra Pradesh's ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) ever since it accepted a special package from the BJP-led NDA government last year in lieu of the special category status. Pawan also alleged that unlike Telangana leaders, Andhra leaders are not decisive and that they have vested interests. The attack comes amid the allegations by the TDP that Pawan has entered into a secret understanding with the BJP. TDP president and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu had criticised the actor for making corruption allegations against the TDP government, instead of targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not fulfilling the promise of a special status. Pawan had been addressing a series of meetings to target TDP. He had also described the special package as a ""stale laddu"". Meanwhile, reacting sharply to Pawan's latest remarks on special status, state minister Amarnath Reddy said this proved beyond doubt that he is playing into the hands of the BJP.

A bench of justices AK Goel and UU Lalit ruled that no arrests can be made under the Act without prior permission.

20,Aviral Virk Neeraj Gupta,84th Congress Plenary of Many Firsts & A Serious Mosquito Problem,"It would be a â€œworkerâ€™s plenaryâ€, stressed the spokespersons who remained constantly around the media bay at the Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, which was hosting the 84th plenary of the Indian National Congress. The venue, incidentally was the second choice after Talkatora, which was found to be booked for another political event. Nevertheless, the buzz ahead of the 16-18 March Congress â€œ â€ as Navjot Singh Sidhu called it, was to allow loyal, grassroots-level, even booth-level Congress workers to dominate the stage, to address the plenary. Even the stage was cleared, as Congress President Rahul Gandhi said, of the â€˜ â€™ on which leaders like Gandhi, Nehru and Azad once sat, to make space for the ordinary worker. But the plan fell through,   at the AICC general secretary and state-in-charge level, as they failed to give timely instructions to short-list names of workers who could travel to Delhi to address the plenary. Among those general secretaries was Digvijaya Singh, who skipped the plenary owing to his Narmada Parikrama â€“ a 1600-km-long   across 110 of the 230 Assembly constituencies that will vote in a new Assembly later this year. His son, Jaivardhan Singh, who at 31 is the youngest member of the Madhya Pradesh Assembly, was seen interacting with party workers and the media. Confident that the Congress will dislodge Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led Bharatiya Janata Party government, which has been in power in the state for 15 years, Jaivardhan Singh spoke candidly about the tussle between senior leaders including his father, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamla Nath, vying for the top job in the state. â€œThis time, it will be different. Because our senior leaders realise that this is the most crucial year in the history of the Madhya Pradesh Congress. All three leaders will work together. As soon as Digvijaya Singhâ€™s   ends, the three leaders will sit together to draw out an election strategyâ€, he told  . The issue of infighting among senior party leaders was also mentioned by the Congress president in his nearly 50-minute speech at the end of the plenary. â€œFight if you must, but after the electionâ€, he said. â€œDisagreements are normal, but for the next six to seven months, we have to maintain strict discipline.â€ Expected to be more difficult than taking on Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself, affecting real change in the Congress is the biggest challenge for the party. To this effect, the Congress president announced that no longer will senior leaders be parachuted into a constituency and no longer will a hard-working party worker, who may not have the money to fund his campaign, be denied a ticket to contest elections. The announcement was met with the loudest applause the 84th Congress plenary witnessed in its three days. But will the second generation of party leaders agree to set aside personal ambitions for the future of the party as a whole? Will Rahul Gandhi end up replacing the â€˜old guardâ€™ with just a younger, equally inaccessible version of it? Apart from motivating his cadre, the Congress president is also tasked with managing the personal ambitions of his closest aides. Apart from keeping the stage bereft of any lounging leaders, this was the first plenary moderated by younger leaders like Sushmita Dev, Ragini Nayak and Nadeem Javed. Earlier sessions have been conducted by senior leaders like Motilal Vora and Janardan Dwivedi. The stage was surrounded by high-tech LED screens, and camera-mounted cranes, offering an uninterrupted view of the stage to the stadium which was filled to its capacity through the day. The final arrangements â€“ right from the stage, to the background on the LED when Rahul Gandhi would speak, even the (ineffective) fumigation â€“ were overseen by Priyanka Gandhi whoâ€™s believed to have spent several hours at the venue, on the night before the plenary kickstarted. But it is when the crowds broke for lunch, that the logistical nightmare of managing 15,000 party workers and a massive media contingent, became a reality. However the situation was better handled on Day 2, with senior leaders like Ahmad Patel making the rounds in the media room. Seeing a journalist whack a mosquito, he acknowledged that the condition of the stadium was crumbling. â€œAnd weâ€™re paying a rental of Rs 8 lakh a dayâ€, someone behind him whispered. The big headline of the 84th Plenary, before it began, was that it would ratify Rahul Gandhiâ€™s election as the Congress President. The question then was, whether Sonia Gandhi would speak at the event and what would her role in the party be in the future. Although, Congress communications-in-charge, Randeep Surjewala had ruled out the possibility of Sonia Gandhi speaking at the Congress Plenary, the United Progressive Alliance chairperson took the stage on Saturday, 17 March, following a discussion moderated by the Congressâ€™ Rajya Sabha nominee from Maharashtra Kumar Ketkar. Ketkar was incidentally handpicked by Gandhi over other party veterans like Ratnakar Mahajan, whose name was among two others forwarded by the state unit. Taking the podium after an emotional hug from her son, Sonia Gandhi tore into the â€œdrunk on powerâ€ Modi government. â€œThe slogans of â€˜ â€™ and â€˜ â€™ are only  â€, she said. Journalists nodded. They had the headline for the day. In fact, the presence of regional media, even those who have bureaus in Delhi, was significant, ensuring surround sound coverage of the plenary. Among other things, Rahul Gandhi also went from being @OfficeOfRG on Twitter to just @RahulGandhi. Not only did this generate enough online chatter for the Congressâ€™ hyperactive social media team, but also conveyed an attempt to shake off the tag of a â€œreluctant politicianâ€ and a leader who wasnâ€™t speaking or tweeting for himself. The effort had began in October, last year, when Gandhi responded to claims that a dedicated team of social media experts handled his account. He sarcastically posted that it was his pet dog, Pidi who was tweeting for him, along with a video of the little pooch. Borrowing a leaf from Modiâ€™s social media habits, the Congress went from mocking Narendra Modi for his selfie obsession to a bit of self-indulgence on social media. Even as Navjot Singh Sidhu got up to speak, he air swung his imaginary bat into the air, to a loud cheer from the party workers. One of the Congressâ€™ most powerful orators, Sidhuâ€™s apology to Dr Manmohan Singh won the hearts of the party workers. Whether it will get him a seat in the partyâ€™s top leadership, however is debatable. There was however, a general consensus that a leader with his oratory skills could serve the Congressâ€™ purpose better in the Rajya Sabha. Of all the spokespersons in the BJPâ€™s star-studded line up, the Bharatiya Janata Party fielded Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to counter the allegations, related not just to defence procurements, but also the blistering attack launched by Rahul Gandhiâ€™s closing speech. Incidentally, Defense Minister in the UPA government, AK Antony, who was responsible for the report that listed the reasons for the partyâ€™s 2014 loss, was not heard from. Neither was his report or any of the reasons listed in it for the electoral debacle deliberated upon.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

21,Neeraj Gupta,Yogi Governmentâ€™s First Year in Power,"â€œMay God never grant anyone such a gift on their first birthdayâ€ is probably what Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanthâ€™s well-wishers are saying. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that carried out encounters as a state policy, ended up at the receiving end of a political encounter by the public in the UP by-elections. The party not only lost Yogiâ€™s Gorakhpur seat, they also lost Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Mauryaâ€™s Phulpur seat. The BJP leaders, who were singing songs of victory over Tripura until recently, are today humming the poem of their â€˜guideâ€™ Atal Bihari Vajpayee: What made the public completely reject the â€˜Yogi rajâ€™ that has been running UP for the past one year? investigates. Leading a population of 22 crore people is no easy job â€“ but when Yogi  came to power, it seemed like he would change everything. On 19 March 2017, when Yogi took charge of UP, his biggest challenge was law and order. To this end, three steps were taken: In the beginning, the â€˜Anti-Romeoâ€™ squads captured headlines â€“ but no clear guidelines were formulated for the police. Incidents of unnecessary harassment of boys and girls became common. Today, there is no sign of that squad. The ban on slaughter houses in Uttar Pradesh right after the BJP government took charge was advertised by Yogi  as one of his achievements. This step created fear among Muslims. Under the guise of gau raksha, stories of harassment and even murders of people â€“ most of whom were Muslims â€“ became common. Today, the biggest problem for UPâ€™s farmers are the old abandoned cows who enter their farms during the night and destroy their crops. Under the Yogi government, the police were given such a free reign to carry out encounters that people started calling Uttar Pradesh â€˜Encounter Pradesh.â€™ Questions were raised about police actions in some cases, but Yogi  stood firm on his decision. It seemed to be a direct message to miscreants â€“ chant â€œYogi-Yogiâ€ if you want to stay in UP. According to government estimates, in the past one year, the UP Police has killed 40 people in 1,200 encounters. This means there have been 100 encounters every month and at least three-four â€˜criminalsâ€™ killed each month. You must remember Kasganj. In the communal violence that was sparked off on 26 January, one person was killed while public life was brought to a standstill for days. The BJPâ€™s promise of a fear-free India seemed to have gone up in smoke. According to central government estimates, in 2017, Uttar Pradesh had the highest instances of communal violence. Apart from Kasganj, there were 195 instances of communal violence in which 44 people were killed and 542 were left injured. Farmers who were upset at not getting the right price for their produce, dumped thousands of quintals of potatoes in front of Yogi  house and the Assembly. In October 2017, farmers were so upset at the low cost of sugarcane that they burned it right outside the UP Assembly. The government mentions loan waivers for farmers as a big achievement, but most farmers claim they havenâ€™t benefited from it. Yogi , the farmers are angry, and if they donâ€™t come around, then reaping votes in 2019 will become difficult. Just a few days after the BJP took charge, the issue of childrenâ€™s deaths in Gorakhpurâ€™s BRD Hospital became a nuisance for Yogi Adityanath. According to Health and Family Welfare Department numbers, deaths caused by Japanese encephalitis have gone up in the last year. Cases of chikungunya and the number of deaths caused by dengue, though, have decreased. In 2016, while 73 people died from Japanese Encephalitis, 80 died in the past year. Dengue claimed 42 deaths in 2016, while 28 succumbed to the disease in 2017. And while there were 2,458 cases of chikungunya in 2016, there were 94 in 2017. In the recently concluded Investor Summit in Lucknow, Chief Minister Yogi promised to create 40 lakh jobs in the next three years. Hopefully, he hasnâ€™t included roadside pakora vendors in this list. He has also been talking about filling the three lakh empty positions in the police and Education Department. There are currently 1.37 lakh empty positions in the education sector, and 1.62 lakh empty positions in the police force. Yogi , I agree that you are the star campaigner. Your saffron garb reflects the mix of Hindutva and nationalism that is the BJPâ€™s DNA. But will your â€˜Singhamâ€™ image â€“ formed due to your policy of encounters â€“ be able to calm the restless youth? Will farmers be distracted from their troubles by the Hindu-Muslim divide? The answer is no... People have sent a message in these by-elections. Consider this message a warning, because there isnâ€™t much time left till the 2019 general elections. As they say, the road to power to the Centre goes through UP.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political
22,Reuters,Ex-French President Sarkozy in Custody in Campaign Funding Probe,"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday, 20 March, was placed in police custody for questioning by magistrates looking into allegations of Libyan funding for his 2007 election campaign, an official in the French judiciary said. France opened a judicial inquiry in 2013 into allegations that Sarkozy's successful 2007 election bid benefited from illicit funds from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, has always denied receiving any illicit campaign funding and has dismissed the Libyan allegations as ""grotesque.â€ In January, a French businessman suspected by investigators of funnelling money from Gaddafi to finance Sarkozy's campaign was arrested in Britain and granted bail after he appeared in a London court. Sarkozy has already been ordered to stand trial in a separate matter concerning financing of his failed re-election campaign in 2012, when he was defeated by Francois Hollande.

23,Arun Dev,Siddaramaiahâ€™s Lingayat Decision Kills Many Birds With One Stone - The Quint,"It was a rebellion against the caste system, the vedic culture and the Brahminic practices among Veerashaiva Hindus that led to the creation of the Lingayat religion by 12th century social reformer Basavanna . Several centuries later, on 19 March 2018, Veerashaivas have been presented with a choice once again â€“ follow Basavanna or the Vedas. With a carefully drafted decision, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has managed to help his party through another catch-22 situation. The decision has not only paved the way for him to get votes from a BJP stronghold, but also put an end to a dispute which had threatened to affect him in the assembly elections. A decision to separate Lingayats from Veerashaivas would have kicked off a political storm in the state, as both communities were considered one, for many centuries despite their differences. At the same time, giving a religious status to Lingayats was the only way for the Congress to tap into BJPâ€™s biggest vote bank. The solution for the dilemma was a smart, carefully worded decision on the problem. Siddaramaiah made a smart move by announcing a religion with the names of both sub-sects in it. This decision helped the Congress control the political retaliation from the BJP, as Lingayat leaders in BJP, including their Chief Ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa, had endorsed religious status for the Lingayat-Veerashaiva. BJP leaders were only opposed to a separate Lingayat religion. At the same, the Lingayat sect was particular in the demands that they wanted to be separated from the Veerashaiva community, who followed the vedic tradition. To fulfill this demand, a clause was added to the decision that only those Veerashaivas practicing the teachings of Basavanna will be a part of the new religion. The BJP will not be able to question the clause either, as Basavannaâ€™s teachings are considered sacred in the state. The Lingayat sect was formed by the 12th century social reformer Basavanna, who opposed vedic rituals and casteist practices in the Hindu religion. His followers were taught to worship their  (God of choice), in a direct and personal manner, without any Brahminic practices. The progressive nature of the new sect attracted followers from across castes and communities in 12th century. Over the centuries, following Basasvannaâ€™s death, the Brahminic practices opposed by him found its way to the religion, leading to the merger of Lingayats and Veerashaivas. The word Lingayat has since been used to represent both communities. It was the research by scholars like MM Kalburgi that brought back the knowledge that Lingayat is a religion distinct from Hinduism, which resulted in a political movement for a separate religion. After the cabinet decision recommending the new religion was announced, senior Congress party leaders insisted that the move was not a political one. They claimed that the movement for religious status has been around for several decades. Although their claim was factually correct, the Congress had indeed laid the foundation for a political breakthrough for the party. The Lingayats are considered the largest community in the state and the biggest vote bank; and during the last decade, they are known to have en bloc voted for the BJP. After the announcement of the new religion, Siddaramaiah hopes for a switch in loyalty from the Lingayat community ahead of the assembly elections. Being a religious minority, the Lingayats can avail rights to set up educational institutions and other benefits such as reservations in government jobs. In order to avail these benefits, a Veerashaiva only has to agree to follow Basavannaâ€™s teachings. While it was expected that the new religion would create a divide between both communities, these benefits may bring several Veerashaivas to the new Lingayat religion. The according of a separate religion status gives many Veerashaiva an opportunity to avail these benefits. Congress hopes of Lingayat votes swinging has a historical background as well. The Lingayat vote bank has never stayed with a single party. It was a series of events consisting of party splits, party mergers, coalition and deaths of leaders, that propelled BJPâ€™s Yeddyurappa as the face of the Lingayat community. The Lingayat votes were traditionally with the Congress party. But when the party split into two factions in 1969, most of senior Lingayat leaders went to the Congress (O) faction. Years later, this faction of the Congress merged with the newly formed Janata Party, taking the Lingayat Votes to the Janata Party. The Janata Party later became Janata Dal, and in late 1990â€™s split into two parties, JD(S) and JD(U); and the Lingayat leaders in Janata Dal went with the JD(U). In 2004, JD(U) joined hands with BJP to contest 2004 elections. By then, the senior Lingayat leaders who had migrated from Congress, along with the Lingayat votes, exited politics, making BS Yeddyurappa a Lingayat leader by coincidence. The history of the transfer of the Lingayat votes gives the Congress hope of securing these in the upcoming Assembly elections. After the announcement, it is the BJP that finds itself in a catch-22 situation. Now that the state government has written to the Modi government seeking approval for the new religion by the National Minority Commission, the ball is in BJPâ€™s court. As the proposal readies for the centre, with both Veerashaiva and Lingayat names, many leaders in the BJP who demanded a religious status for the joint community will find it tough to oppose the decision. And even if the central government decides to turn the proposal, it will bring them the wrath of the community whose support it is banking upon ahead of the elections. Political implications of this recommendation will be significant in deciding the outcome of the upcoming elections. The BJP is expected to claim this was Siddaramaiahâ€™s attempt to divide the Hindu community and further Hindutva agenda. While the Congress will get back on the planning boards, hoping to get a big share of the Lingayat votes.   (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

24,Sujeev Shakya,"Nepal Moves Towards Economic Development, India Must Chip In","After three months of provincial and federal elections and a month after being sworn in as Nepalâ€™s Prime Minister, KP Oli announced the names in his 21-member Cabinet. The alliance between the Communist Party of Nepal, the United Marxist Leninist (UML) and the United Maoist Center won 116 seats out of the 165 directly elected representative seats and 58 out of the 110 proportional representation seats. The elections were won on two major points. First, whipping up the nationalism sentiment, as KP Oli did during his stand-off with India during the blockade in September 2015. When Nepal was reeling in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in 2015, the Indian blockade put the lives of 28 million people at risk. Second, the elections were fought on the agenda of economic development and prosperity. Voters were disenchanted with the Nepali Congress, especially its president and incumbent Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba; and there were no other alternatives apart from a newly-formed Bibeksheel Sajha Party, that was fighting their first elections in a few places. The Indian External Affairs Minister was in Nepal to congratulate PM Oli, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Nepal later this year. The Eminent Persons Group (EPG), formed between India and Nepal to review the 1950 treaty, is also getting its report ready for final touches. Unlike the one in India, the new federal structure empowers the municipalities and village councils â€“ these local bodies cannot be removed for five years. The move is expected to provide much needed stability in a country where government changes every nine months had become a norm. There has to be a better understanding of the new structures in Nepal and therefore, India will have to re-calibrate its engagement. Second, Prime Minister KP Oli has brought in several eminent leaders into his Cabinet. Former Central Bank Governor and National Planning Vice Chair is the Finance Minister; This is the first time Nepal has seen a technocrat get this position after successive finance ministers who had no clue about economics. With trusted lieutenant Pradip Gyawali as Foreign Minister, the expectations are high. Similarly, picks like Rabindra Adhikari as Tourism Minister and erstwhile popular Gokarna Bista as Labour Minister also indicate Oliâ€™s choice for popular new generation leaders. Finally, investment is the key to the growth and development of Nepal. India has the opportunity to be the country that will partner in Nepalâ€™s journey to the future, but timely action is important. Nepal is home to a population of 14 million below the age of 25. This young population, that is bombarded with new life aspirations, via social media and growing internet penetration, will be looking to partner with a country that can fulfil their dreams. Gone are the days when in Delhi one talked to Nepalis as though they were North Koreans in South Korea. Understanding the economic opportunities in a country with an economy of USD 60 billion (formal and informal) and higher per capita than the neighbouring states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh will be key. This is yet another opportunity for India to re-engage. We can only hope that it will not squander it away like it has done in the past. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

26,PTI,"â€˜Inspiredâ€™ By Rahul, Goa Cong Chief Resigns To Pave Way for Youth - The Quint","Goa Congress President Shantaram Naik on Tuesday, 20 March, resigned from his post, saying he was ""inspired"" by Rahul Gandhi's speech at the party plenary about making way for younger leaders. Naik, 71, is the first senior Congress leader to resign after Rahul Gandhi announced on Sunday, 18 March, in his concluding speech that he wants to give the younger generation a chance to come forward and lead the party. Naik has sent his resignation to the All India Congress Committee this morning, ending his stint as Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president since 8 July 2017 when he had replaced senior party leader Luizinho Faleiro. During the session, the entire stage was empty, and only those who were delivering speeches went up and spoke from the podium, he said. ""Everyone, including Sonia Gandhi, was off the dais,"" Naik told PTI. ""When Rahul Gandhi went up to deliver the speech, he said the stage was kept empty so as to let the younger generation take over the reins. My resignation is to make way for the young leadership to take over,"" the former MP said. In his concluding remarks at the 84th plenary session, Gandhi sought to woo the youth to join the Grand Old Party ahead of the 2014 general election and declared that he had emptied the stage for them to occupy, pointing to the huge dais which only had a podium for speakers and no seating arrangements. â€œTo every youngster in India, we are your instrument. The Congress party belong to you. We want to open our doors to your talent, your bravery and your energy. This country is struggling and it needs you,â€ Rahul had said. Naik was elected to Lok Sabha in 1984 from North Goa constituency and twice to Rajya Sabha later. Congress, with 16 legislators, is currently the main opposition in the Goa Legislative Assembly. Naik said he was turning 72 and wanted the young to now lead the party. ""I only want to suggest that somebody who has put in at least 10 years in the party and has love and commitment for the party should be given a chance to come forward and lead the party in the country,"" he said.

28,Raghav Bahl,Will Opposition Get CLEAN-BOWLEDDD by Modiâ€™s GOOGLY - The Quint,"If the conventional saying is that a week is a long time in politics, then a fortnight could well pack a double punch of change, as we experienced in India during the ides of March. On the third of this astrologically quirky month, the BJP knocked the stuffing out of the Leftists in Tripura and the Congress in the rest of the northeast. Our quicksilver commentators jumped on the â€œhail victorâ€ bandwagon, but I was restrained, even skeptical. At the end of the day, democratic politics is about numbers and majorities. Just one statistic should be enough to temper the euphoria: â€œ â€ is now a stale  (slogan) for them. Its â€œsell byâ€ date truly got over today. The challenge for Prime Minister Modi is to convince his erstwhile voters with a new narrative. Nobody should uncork the champagne until then! Gosh, even I am astounded at how accurately prophetic my words turned out to be just 11 days later on 14 March, when votes were counted in the by-elections in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Quite apart from uncorking any champagne, even the  (local) variety produced in the vineyards of Nagpur, the BJP got trounced everywhere, including in fortress Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanathâ€™s impregnable citadel since 1998. Note that I did not dare name this constituency among those with an â€œuncertain verdict,â€ since it was foolish even to think about any other outcome. The BJPâ€™s rout was so vexingly one-sided that commentators took refuge in simplistic analyses. Almost overnight, most political pundits put on their â€œRamanujan capsâ€ to trot out reams of mathematical worksheets: I am sure your head must be spinning around this welter of theoretical number crunching. But whatever the merit of this â€œwhat if, post facto arithmetic,â€ one thing is clear â€“ the BJP will dread an SP+BSP tie up in 2019, which could singularly take away as many as 50 seats from its current kitty, throwing the upcoming poll â€œwide openâ€ (another favourite clichÃ© of the pundits). But wait. Remember that in 2014, a chunk of the BJP vote was cast personally for the wildly popular candidate, Narendra Modi. While the Congress votes stayed static at around 110 million (11 crore) between 2009 and 2014, the BJPâ€™s votes leapt from about 80 million (8 crore) to 170 million (17 crore). Although nothing can be said with 100 percent accuracy, one can safely assume that most of these additional 90 million (9 crore) BJP voters were â€œfans of Modi.â€ They were electrified by his promise of aspirational change of â€œ â€ (good days). Since Modi was not directly on the ballot paper in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, can we use that data to infer that â€œfans of Modiâ€ have turned away from him? Or would they be willing to give him another chance? Or has the â€œ â€ promise become the â€œIndia Shiningâ€ millstone around Modiâ€™s neck? Remember that Modi is a tireless campaigner. His rhetorical skills are unmatched. He is perfectly capable of extending the tenure of his â€œ â€ promise by trying to convince voters that 2014-19 was â€œjust the first innings,â€ where he was cleaning up the past mess. â€œMy real work will begin now, in the second innings,â€ he could claim with his trademark bombast. Given his penchant for acronyms, I am tempted to second guess what Prime Minister Modi could coin as his re-election slogan for 2019. Here goes: And hereâ€™s what the acronyms GOOGLY and CLEAN-BOWLEDDD will stand for: (Modi will claim that â€œI have neutralised a criminal Opposition and jaded old guard in my first tenureâ€) (Modi will further claim that â€œyou have to give me a second tenure as your prime minister, because I will now build a clean new India that will become a world leader riding energetically on our three core strengths of digitisation, democracy and demographyâ€) Itâ€™s going to be tough and challenging. The initial flush of success in combining Opposition votes in Uttar Pradesh is just the tiny shuffle a batsman does before lunging down the pitch to smother a googly on the front foot. The SP+BSP+Congress tie up in UP and the Congress+NCP alliance in Maharashtra are just tiny shuffles. If the opposition batsmen were to stop at this, stranded at the crease, they are bound to get clean bowled. They must lunge forward with full force and smother the spin, perhaps even dance down the pitch and lift the googly for a six. How? By smothering their respective egos and trying to pull off the seemingly impossible: Craft a TMC-Congress alliance in West Bengal, ceding dominance to Mamata Bannerjee. Declare Jagan Reddy as a combined Congressâ€™ unquestioned satrap in Andhra Pradesh. It may sound outlandish but reach out to Himanta Biswa Sarma with the promise of leading Assam. And why canâ€™t Nitish Kumar be wooed back into an RJD+Congress embrace? Wonâ€™t that be the kayo punch? Isnâ€™t politics the art of the possible? (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Ken Isaacs spoke with reporters on Monday as the 169 member states of the International Organisation for Migration prepare to elect a successor to longtime diplomat William Lacy Swing as director-general in June. An intergovernmental body that became a UN-related agency two years ago, IOM has had only one director-general who wasn't American since its creation in 1951. Portugal's Antonio Vitorino, a Socialist politician, and IOM deputy director-general Laura Thompson of Costa Rica are also in the running against Isaacs. Isaacs, a vice president at the evangelical Christian humanitarian organisation Samaritan's Purse, which is led by Franklin Graham, pointed to his track record in the field and as a manager, saying that IOM's work is ""in my wheelhouse."" Isaacs said he sees the role of IOM director as twofold: Helping migrants and helping states manage migration issues. He said he recognizes ""the sovereign rights of states to form their own domestic immigration policy"" yet understands why people sometimes must leave their homes or homelands. ""I understand why people migrate â€” I understand what that looks like, what that smells like, what that feels like,"" Isaacs said. ""I understand what it means to bring 15 or 20 bodies out of a camp in the morning where people migrated to run away from war and bury them."" But he said he is more than just a relief worker in the field. ""Leadership, vision, management, accountability, transparency â€” these are all hallmarks of Samaritan's Purse and this is who I am,"" he said in the interview at the US mission in Geneva. ""Judge me on what I've done."" reported that Isaacs' comments in the media had suggested that Islam was an intrinsically violent religion and that he denied climate change. noted an exchange on Twitter in June after a terror attack in London in which Isaacs wrote ""'this' is exactly what the Muslim faith instructs the faithful to do."" The newspaper said it received a statement from Isaacs expressing regret for comments that ""caused hurt and undermined my professional record."" CNN last week also noted a number of retweets from Isaacs of comments that criticised Muslims. As for climate change, the United Nations and many countries have cited scientific studies that underpin their battle against global warming caused by human activity. Isaacs said he backed IOM's strategic efforts, but declined to say if he supported the science pointing to man-made climate change. ""Whether I do or whether I don't does not take away from the fact that climate disasters happen,"" Isaacs said, adding that he knows ""the strategic objectives of IOM in regards to climate change, and I agree with those.""

31,Shadab Moizee,Delhi Sealing: Why Did the Govt Levy Taxes If Shops Were Illegal? - The Quint,"For the last three months, shops and businesses are getting sealed in Delhi. Many shopkeepers and traders have come on the road and have constantly been protesting against sealing.  reaches Lajpat Nagar's double-storey market to find out more on the issue. Around 450 shops have been sealed there. Businesspeople say that they did not receive any prior notice regarding the sealing. Sealing of shops had started in 2006 when Sheila Dixit was in power. According to master plan 2021, commercial shops were to be closed down. In 2005, High court ordered to take actions against illegal construction.. The matter then reached High court due to Municipal Corporation Delhiâ€™s behaviour. The Supreme Court ordered to seal all illegal constructions in 2006. After which, many sealings took place. There were many tussles between the police and the shopkeepers, where four people died in it too. The issue got bigger when the government in 2006 introduced convergent charge rule for shops and commercial properties. SC ceased sealing for sometime then. The issue was raised yet again when the SC ordered to form a monitoring committee to seal shops and properties. The shops that had not given convergent charge were sealed. Now shopkeepers demand that government should take immediate actions. According to them, its not justified to collect convergent charge from local shopping centres, since they are commercial. They should not be sealed either. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political
32,The Quint,Five Firebrand Speakers Who Can Give BJP a Headache - The Quint,"In contemporary politics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considered a great orator. His oratory skills are often yielded by the Bhartiya Janta Party as a weapon to keep the opposition from rising. But as the heat at the Congress Plenary 2018 intensified, so did the partyâ€™s enthusiasm. As Navjot Singh Siddhu took charge in his full form, party workers clenched their fists in determination and the claps did not stop. His pink turban gleaming and his spirits undeterred and unfettered. Judging from the way Navjot Singh Siddhu and Raj Thakeray on 18 March unleashed a strong verbal tornado on the BJP, and the rate at which their speeches have been viewed over and over in the last 24 hours, it has become amply clear that these two orators can become a cause of a massive headache for the BJP. This argument can further be corroborated by the fact that in the past few days, the two big speeches that PM Modi gave got less viewership on social media than his speeches normally do. While Siddhuâ€™s video got more that 2.5 lakh views within 24 hours on Quint Hindiâ€™s Youtube channel alone. So does this mean that PM Modi's oration is facing competition by that of these five: Navjot Singh Siddhu, Raj Thakeray, Kanhaiya Kumar, Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani. The run up to 2019 elections is going to see a slew of verbal attacks. In this case the Congress party and the Opposition can make their game stronger by putting fourth these five orators. Here's how: There was once a time when Siddhu would don the saffron turban. He was also elected as a BJP MLA from Amritsar. But his political ambitions grew, there were tiffs and he did not take too much time to climb down the BJP vehicle and get on to the Congress caravan. It also did not take him too long to change the environment in Punjab and to crawl into the hearts of the Punjabis. Siddhu is one of those orators know how to deliver a punch while making a point. He puts across his views with admirable strength and impact. His speeches may sometimes lack content, but the last person in his audience will also not miss the impact. The speech he gave at the Congress Plenary has been viewed millions of times on Youtube. While Siddhu is getting praises for his speech, some are also questioning his loyalty since he is one of those who switched parties in the middle of his political career. It is also interesting to note that a number of comments on Youtube have suggested that Congress should use Siddhu to put across their important arguments. They are saying Congress should give Siddhu a chance to raise important issues in front of PM Modi. At a rally on the occasion of ""Gudi Padwa"" in Mumbai, it was hard for anybody to miss Raj Thakeray's style and the fury burning on his face. He spoke with passion in favour of an India without Modi. In his speech, Raj Thakeray said: Raj Thackeray is anyway famous for his political fervor. In the coming days, PM Modi and the BJP should watch out for Thackeray's verbal attacks. Kanhaiya can be called a social media sensation. Till a while ago this title used to belong to PM Modi too. But now PM Modi's social media shine is beginning to wear off. Kanhaiya's statements and speeches are shared wildly on social media. They are viewed crores of times. A News18 video, in which he comes face-to-face with BJP's Sambit Patra, has been viewed more than 1 million times on the official YouTube channel of News18 India and lakhs of times on other YouTube channels. Kanhaiya carries with himself the JNU brand. The same brand which is extremely popular among the youth. His language carries the rustic appeal of someone who is grounded and does not have too many airs and graces. These qualities make his speeches stronger. In the upcoming days, Kanhaiya's speeches can also become a grave threat for the Modi government. Even though Hardik Patel did not make any great achievement in the 2017 Vidhan Sabha polls, the man sure knows how to collect a crowd and garner a resounding applause. Be it his Surat rally or his Twitter adventures, Hardik Patel shines everywhere. Hardik can rise again in 2019 in Gujarat and create an impact again. In the last few days, if any politician has risen as a champion of Dalit voices it is Jignesh Mevani. You see him fighting with the police. You see him on the streets fighting for their supporters. And he is sharp in his oration. Jignesh has established himself as the voice of Dalits. Mevani's Hindi may not be that clear, but his tongue lacks any ambiguity. He is straightforward and he speaks without any qualms. The youth, and especially that from Gujarat, seems to be growing very fond of him. This is probably why his videos are also getting lakhs of views on YouTube. These five can prove treacherous for the BJP, and the party has enough reason to be really careful of them. Pitted against these five, if you look at PM Modi's last two speeches it will not take too long to realise that his viewership is diminishing. The speech delivered by the PM at the ""Krishi Unnati Mela"" on 17 March got about 1,000 views on BJP's official YouTube channel and only about 7,000 even on PM Modi's official channel as of 19 March 6:30 pm. So is there something that is changing? Are PM Modi's speeches gradually becoming boring even for his admirers? In the run up to 2019, BJP and PM Modi himself will have to ponder over this as well as over ways to do better than the five powerful orators listed above.

33,IANS,India Hosts 2-Day Mini-Ministerial Meet to Break WTO Impasse - The Quint,"Discussions at the WTO's ongoing mini-minsterial meeting in New Delhi will be useful for the global trade body to progress on issues like the earlier Doha Round of negotiations and its dispute settlement system, WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo said on Monday, 19 March. ""The Delhi meeting will be informal as well as important. I hope it will be directed and the inputs here will be useful for our meeting in Geneva, to take the negotiations forward on items in the Doha Round and on other issues,"" Azevedo told reporters at a briefing organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Azevedo called on PM Modi thanking the Indian government for taking the initiative of starting conversation to explore ways to reinvigorate multilateral trading system, Ministry of External Affairs said. PM Narendra Modi reiterated that India is a strong supporter of multilateral trading system. He stated that it is imperative to prioritise WTOâ€™s activities so that it addresses the concerns of developing countries. Following the collapse of WTO Buenos Aires ministerial talks last December, India has called this informal meeting of ministers, without a pre-announced agenda, to facilitate an exchange of views on various challenges facing the multilateral trading system ""with the hope that it will lead to political guidance on some major issues"". The talks at the 11th ministerial conference at Buenos Aires broke down as the US reneged on its commitment, along with other countries, to find a permanent solution to the issue of public food stockholding by WTO members. The US representative to declared in a small group meeting that a permanent solution to the food stockholding issue was not acceptable to America. Under WTO norms, a member-country's food subsidy bill should not breach the limit of 10 per cent of the value of production based on the reference price of 1986-88. India has been seeking amendments to the formula on stockholding, fearing that full implementation of its food security programme could result in breaching the WTO subsidy limit. At the Buenos Aires ministerial, India continued to press for the reduction of farm subsidies by developed countries and resisted inclusion of new issues on the negotiating table like e-commerce and investment facilitation into the ongoing Doha Round of talks that have a developmental agenda in case these dilute the commitment to complete the existing agenda. Protectionism and the US President Donald Trump slapping import tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium last week, unfolding the prospect of an all-out global trade war, are among other issues likely to be discussed at the New Delhi meeting. ""It is a moment of many challenges inside the WTO and outside. The trade environment is very risky at this point,"" Azevedo said. Noting that the US has reiterated various times its support for the WTO, Azevedo said that it also has concerns, but about the functioning of the multilateral body. The US feels that conditions have changed much since the WTO's inception in 1995 and that ""some upgrades and reforms are in order"", he added.   (What does the first-time woman voter want?

35,The News Minute,Sasikalaâ€™s Husband Natarajan Dies: The Man Who Thirsted for Power - The Quint,"Natarajan Maruthappa, businessman and husband of J Jayalalithaa's aide Sasikala Natarajan, died at a private hospital in Chennai in the wee hours of Tuesday, 20 March. Natarajan had been admitted to the Gleneagles Global Hospital in Chennai after his condition deteriorated a few days ago and he had been placed on ventilator. Sasikala, lodged in Bengaluru Central prison after she was found guilty in a disproportionate assets case was allowed to visit her ailing husband on parole. As his condition became critical, friends and family gathered at the hospital on Saturday evening, 17 March. TTV Dinakaran, who had recently announced his party and is Sasikala's nephew, also reached the hospital on Saturday. MDMK leader Vaiko also paid a visit to the hospital. In an earlier statement, the hospital had said that Natarajan was admitted to the intensive care unit on 16 March with severe chest infection. A man who has repeatedly claimed â€œI made Jayalalithaa chief minister,â€ Natarajan was someone who preferred to remain close to power centres. He was quite candid about his ambition to become a power centre himself, and at one point in time, it was speculated among political circles in Tamil Nadu that Natarajan fancies himself as the CM of Tamil Nadu, and Jayalalithaa as the country's Prime Minister. Born in Vilar village in Thanjavur, Natarajan used to describe himself as a student leader who had worked closely with the DMK. In 1973, M Natarajan, who was an employee in the stateâ€™s Directorate of Information and Public Relations, married Sasikala. DMK chief and then chief minister M Karunanidhi even presided over their wedding. But the couple went through trying times early in their marriage. In an interview to Shobha Warrier for Rediff, V Chandralekha, who was the collector of South Arcot in the early 1980s, said Natarajan had lost his job as an assistant publicity officer during the Emergency and remained unemployed for four years between 1976 and 1980. While he was eventually reinstated and posted as Chandralekhaâ€™s PRO following a court case, it was presumably during the intervening period that Sasikala started a video rental shop in Chennai. Soon, the video rental business became videography, after Sasikala went to Singapore to purchase video recorders to film marriages and other functions. It was then that Sasikala turned to her husbandâ€™s boss, Chandralekha, to help boost her fledgling business. Chandralekhaâ€™s introduction was enough to seal the start of a lifelong friendship. After Sasikala and her team filmed several of Jayalalithaaâ€™s functions, â€œsome good association developed,â€ said Natarajan to NDTV. The association developed into trust as Natarajan and his wife stood by Jayalalithaa through one of her darkest hours as a politician, following the death of her mentor and then chief minister MG Ramachandran in 1987. The couple moved in with Jayalalithaa into her 'Veda Nilayam' residence. In 1989, Jayalalithaa came under criticism for being 'heavily manipulated by Natarajan,â€™ but she denied it. However, Natarajan was thrown out in 1996 for trying to dominate Jayalalithaa. Natarajan, however, told NDTV in an interview in 2014 that it was he who broke contact with Jayalalithaa and not the other way around. In the interview, Natarajan claimed that in 1991 even the chief secretary and home secretary were appointed after consultations with him. He said that during her first term as the CM, Jayalalithaa had no option but to listen to him, since she was new to the government. Natarajan prided himself as being a key person in her ascension to power, and in figuring out the nitty-gritties of governance. Even when he was not in Jayalalithaa's good books, bureaucrats and AIADMK leaders used to turn to him during times of trouble. It was widely believed that he still had control over the AIADMK's ticket distribution during elections. A  t from 1998 called him a 'Subramanian Swamy clone' and recalled how Natarajan led a padayatra from Kanyakumari to Chennai that year. He was open about his wish to capture Fort St George, the seat of power. Natarajan was reportedly friends with BSP leaders Kanshi Ram and Mayawati, who used to stay with him during their visit to Chennai. Though he tried to resurrect his political career, Natarajan largely remained in the sidelines till Jayalalithaa's death and even after. In 2011, he and activist Pazha Nedumaran built a memorial in Thanjavur for the victims of the Mullivakal battle (the last LTTE bastion). Though his wife Sasikala continued to remain with Jayalalithaa, Natarajan was never welcomed back. In 2012, the couple received a jolt when Sasikala was thrown out of Jayalalithaa's house. This after reports of Sasikala's family planning a coup reportedly reached Jayalalithaa. However, Sasikala managed to come back to Jayalalithaa, but Natarajan still remained outside. After Jayalalithaa's funeral, he gave interviews to Tamil channels saying that there was no vacuum in the party that could not be filled and that with the blessings of MGR and Jayalalithaa, anyone could run the party. But those plans were not successful as Sasikala's attempt to become chief minister was thwarted by a rebellion by O Panneerselvam. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

37,The Quint,"Raj Thackeray Calls for â€˜Modi-Mukt Bharatâ€™, Takes Digs at Fadnavis - The Quint","Launching a scathing attack on the BJP-led NDA government, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Sunday, 18 March, called for opposition unity and a â€œModi-mukt Bharatâ€ by 2019. Addressing party workers at a rally at Shivaji Park in central Mumbai, Thackeray said: ""India got its first independence in 1947, second in 1977 (after the post-Emergency election) and 2019 can bring a third independence if India becomes Modi-mukt,"" the MNS chief said. If the Modi government was ousted and an inquiry was ordered into demonetisation, it might turn out that itâ€™s the biggest scam in the country since 1947, he said. Quoting an ISRO report, Thackeray asserted: Saying this, he went on to question Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis's claim of digging 56,000 wells in the state. The MNS chief said he was in favour of building a Ram temple in Ayodhya, but it should not be used as an election issue. Taking a dig at Modi's foreign tours, Thackeray said the prime minister was apparently visiting those countries to get ""flour for pakoda"" as the visits had not fetched any investments. The MNS chief also said films like   and  were a covert propaganda for government schemes. Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, who starred in both the films, was trying to follow the footsteps of Manoj Kumar, an actor who was popularly known as ""Bharat Kumar"", he added. Taking potshots at Fadnavis, who recently featured in a video song about river conservation, the MNS chief said, ""There are so many problems in the state, but apparently the CM is busy singing songs."" Thackeray also questioned the government's decision to accord a state funeral to Bollywood actor Sridevi last month. The government was trying to control the media, judiciary and agencies like the CBI, Thackeray said, alleging that the media was under tremendous pressure from the BJP-led government. Case has been registered against members of MNS, on Monday 19 March, for vandalising Gujarati signboards at a shop in Mumbai on 18 March, after Raj Thackeray in his earlier speech said 'Vasai feels like Gujarat these days'. Four accused has been identified and arrested in the case. The cadres of the Raj Thackeray-led party smashed and pulled down over 20 signboards on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway in the district's Vasai area late last night, MNS Thane region president Avinash Jadhav said on Monday, 19 March. ""Vasai and Thane district are in Maharashtra and not Gujarat, and we will not tolerate name boards in Gujarati anymore,"" Jadhav told PTI. He asserted that their agitation against such signboards would continue. The Vasai police control room confirmed the incident, but said no offence had been registered so far.

On 21 December 2017, the special CBI court acquitted 17 people who were charged with both Prevention of Corruption Act and PMLA in the 2G case ED investigation under PMLA revealed that an amount to the tunes of Rs 200 crore was paid by promoters of Swan Telecom (using their group entity Dynamix Realty) to Kalignar TV, in the garb of legitimate financial transaction ie as loan/share application money. According to the agency, this payment was illegal gratification for Raja in lieu of favours given to Swan Telecom while granting 2G licences. Further, the investigation revealed that the return of Rs 200 crore has been done along with the additional amount in order to make the receipt of illegal payment appear as a legal and bonafide financial transaction.

41,Angela Charlton,What to Expect From Putin and a Resurgent Russia Â  - The Quint,"Vladimir Putin now has a stronger hold on Russia and stronger place in the world, thanks to an overwhelming mandate for yet another term as president. His domestic opponents are largely resigned to another six years in the shadows. His foreign opponents are mired in their own problems, from Britain's messy exit from the European Union to chaos and contradiction in the Trump administration. Even widespread voting violations are unlikely to dent Putin's armor. And accusations that he meddled in the US election and sponsored a nerve agent attack in Britain have only bolstered his standing at home. Here's a look at what to expect from Putin's next six years in power, for Russia's rivals, neighbors and its own 147 million citizens. Relations between Russia and the West are already at their lowest level since the collapse of the Soviet Union 26 years ago. Despite a friendly-ish relationship with US President Donald Trump, Putin's new mandate gives him little incentive to seek entente with Washington, especially as the investigation of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US election intensifies. Putin-friendly leaders have made gains in recent Italian and German elections. Western countries are likely to see more Russia-linked hacking and propaganda aimed at disrupting elections or otherwise discrediting democracy â€” including the US midterm elections in November. His claim several weeks ago that Russia has developed new nuclear weapons that can evade missile defenses clearly showed Putin's adamant determination to boost Russia's power to intimidate. Russian-backed Syrian forces helped rout the Islamic State group from Syria, and Putin argues that Russia saved the day in a conflict that had confounded US-led forces fighting against IS. Now those Russian-backed Syrian forces are closing in on the last strongholds of Western-backed rebel forces. An emboldened Putin could position the resurgent Russian military as a peacemaker in other regional conflicts â€” for example in Libya, where Russia has oil interests and where a disastrous Western invasion seven years ago left a lawless state now seething with extremists. To Russians, Putin's biggest victory in 18 years in power was annexing Crimea and crushing Ukraine's ambitions to move closer to the EU and NATO. Putin is frustrated at the resulting US and EU sanctions but appears unwilling to make concessions that would bring them to an end. Ukraine is split between a volatile government in Kiev and a Russia-backed separatist region stuck in a frozen but still deadly conflict that serves Putin's interests. Moscow's actions in Ukraine sent a warning signal to other countries in Russia's orbit that reaching westward is dangerous. And former Soviet bloc states within the EU are increasingly drifting back toward Moscow, from Hungary and Poland to the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Putin's new mandate could theoretically hand him the power to make bold reforms that Russia has long needed to raise living standards and wean itself from its oil dependence. But Putin has convinced Russian voters that drastic change is dangerous, and that protecting the country from threats takes precedence over improving daily life. Experts predict he may enact some changes like expanding affordable housing and fighting corruption on a local level. But less likely are bigger changes such as overhauling the pension system, which is unpopular among a strong Putin voting base, or spending cuts in the security sector, unpopular among the ex-KGB friends in Putin's entourage. Russia has weathered a two-year recession, and inflation and the deficit are low. But personal incomes have stagnated, the health care system is crumbling and corruption is rife. The biggest question for Russians over the next six years is what happens after that. Putin is constitutionally required to step down in 2024, but he could change the rules to eliminate term limits, or anoint a malleable successor and continue to run things behind the scenes. Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Putin's most serious foe, will face further pressure from authorities as he works to expose corruption and official lies. Other Putin rivals such as candidate Ksenia Sobchak and oligarch-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky will try to gain a foothold through upcoming local elections and the parliament. And members of Putin's inner circle will be jockeying for position for the day when he is no longer in the picture. Putin may revive efforts to promote artificial intelligence and other innovation as part of a focus on the younger generation, whose loyalty he needs to ensure his legacy outlives him.

42,Nishtha Gautam,Taslima Nasrinâ€™s Interview: Know About Bangladeshi Author and Former PhysicianÂ ,"â€œIn big cities people donâ€™t invite each other to their homes,â€ laments Taslima Nasrin (also spelt as Nasreen) sitting in her Delhi apartment. And even if they do, Nasrinâ€™s social plans may not unfold like that of her peersâ€™ in the city. I got a taste of this when a bunch of cops stopped me from seeing her before they got a green light from her that I was, indeed, safe for her. Even when the interview had begun, one mufti-clad gentleman hovered around till she sent him out with a clear, â€œItâ€™s ok, they are safe.â€ On her coffee table rests a thick Charlie Hebdo commemorative edition, perched atop a wooden stand which is usually used for the Koran or the Ramayana. Nasrin had visited the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris and the staff gifted her the bright book to show their support to her. She elicited extreme reactions from Muslim organisations for extending support to the publication that came under fire, literally, in 2015 for its irreverent treatment of the Prophet. This irks her no less. â€œLike religious people have the right to express their religious views, I should also have the right to express my non-religious views. And I should not be killed for that.â€ In 1993, Bangladesh was full of posters and fliers that claimed Nasrin had demolished a mosque. The fundamentalists, unsurprisingly, are stranger to irony. Not everyone thinks like that, and certainly not her publishers. Before the camera began to roll, Nasrin had given out enough â€œquotesâ€ to make for an explosive interview. Her displeasure with Penguin was palpable when she flipped through the pages of her newly published book  â€” third of her seven-part autobiography. This English translation carries a blank page with an editorial insert stating the reason for its inclusion. â€œI donâ€™t know why they have done that. They have also used initials for some names. I was not afraid to take names! They have also shortened the title.â€ Such are the dynamics of the industry that very rarely do authors speak uncharitable things about their publishers. Trust Nasrin to be a pioneer everywhere. She is our original â€˜Buri Ladkiâ€™ All Nasrin was doing through her writings was to create a space for women to reclaim agency over their own bodies and challenge the tyranny of the male gaze. Nasrin recounts her travails in Bangladesh during the 90s, when she was a young doctor, deeply committed to poetry of desire and resistance. She married, lived with her lovers, lived alone, travelled with male mentors in a society where no respectable woman would be imagined living such a life. At one point during the interview she almost said the word â€˜sexâ€™ while describing one of her boyfriends. I smile when she says, â€œI had close relations with himâ€ instead. All of us want to see Nasrin, the provocateur; we conveniently zoom out her vulnerabilities. When asked about her father, Dr Rajab Ali, and his patriarchal ways, a shadow of defensiveness falls on her face. A nervous smile before she begins narrating the incident when she was brutally beaten up by him because some newspaper carried a slanderous column about her personal life. â€œHe wanted me to become a doctor. He was an atheist. But one man canâ€™t be perfect in all senses. That column made him mad.â€ No matter their differences, Nasrin repeatedly pleaded with the Bangladesh government to let her come back so that she could se her father. â€œMy father was very ill and I wanted to be with him. The government did not allow me to come back to my country.â€ Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia have kept her away from Bangladesh since 1994. Did she ever try to reach out to them woman to woman? â€œNo, I didnâ€™t. Women in power can be equally cruel as men. A male politician would have done the same thing.â€ Her disappointment with Hasina, a child of the 1971 liberation movement, is deeper than her personal sense of hurt. Nasrin is no stranger to hypocrisy. She rues the fact that even her younger sister, Maumi Yasmin, lacked the courage to stand by her in public. â€œShe was sometimes afraid of being called my sister. When I had all that political problem and the fatwas issued against me, she supported me but was afraid to support me loudly. She was afraid to introduce herself as my sister.â€ In 2005, she was forced to leave West Bengal because some Islamist organisations took offence, as usual, to her writings. â€œIt was unfortunate because I wanted to live in Kolkata. Iâ€™m a Bengali writer and need a cultural environment.â€ These days, however, her â€˜Hindu friendsâ€™ seem to be unhappy with her too. After her 1993 book, Lajja, the BJP took a real liking to Nasrin and supported her freedom of expression. A   was not only insinuated but, perhaps, also expected. â€œIf BJP supports me, I donâ€™t automatically become a BJP supporter. Whatever I like to write, I write. I donâ€™t think what would happen afterwards; whether Iâ€™d be kissed or kicked out, whether Iâ€™ll be used by some peopleâ€¦ because if they use me for their own interest, it is their fault not mine.â€ On her social media feeds, now Hindu fanatics are jostling for space with Muslim fanatics. Nasrin understands its implications. â€œIf because of a handful of intolerant people, I must leave India, it is also not good for India. If I have to support violence to live in India I would rather not live here.â€ Now,   would be a real tragedy since a big Indian city would then lose an accomplished cook who loves to invite people over and stuns her guests with a lavish spread, old Bangladeshi style. Yes, this, too, is Taslima Nasrin. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political
43,Meghnad Bose,"UIDAI Denies Latest Aadhaar Data Leak, Misinforms the Public Again","On Friday,  reported that the Aadhaar details of numerous individuals had been published online by websites including a government site, Indiaâ€™s top football body AIFF, and a private company Starcards India among others. The report did not blame the UIDAI for the data leak. But predictably enough, the UIDAI felt the need to issue a complete nine-point denial on Twitter and in the process, misinformed the public about the matter. Not to mention the obvious, but a simple Google search â€œmera aadhaar meri pehchan filetype:pdfâ€ gives access to the data. So if you want to check the veracity of our article, all you need to do is make one simple online search. Dear UIDAI, when you say that our reports â€œare intentional and irresponsible acts of some unscrupulous elementsâ€ and â€œare far from the realityâ€, youâ€™re wrong. Theyâ€™re not far from reality at all â€“ the reports are stating  , facts that are verifiable by anyone who searches the internet for the phrase â€œmera aadhaar meri pehchan filetype:pdfâ€. UIDAI says that the data leak has â€œnothing to do with the security of Aadhaar and its database. As none of the Aadhaar cards shown are taken from UIDAI database.â€ Nowhere in the   has the UIDAI been blamed for the data leak. Nowhere does it say that the Aadhaar cards shown have been leaked from the UIDAI database. The report is not about the security of the Aadhaar database. The report is about the danger of Aadhaar details of random people being available online, their loss of privacy and increased vulnerability to online frauds and phishing. In fact, whatâ€™s needed from the UIDAI, is acceptance that several organisations that are now repositories of Aadhaar-related data of their employees, need education on how to safeguard such data and their employeesâ€™ privacy. That precaution is essential because if the personal documents of individuals fall into the wrong hands, there is immense scope for misuse of that information. Which is what we have been saying all along! Which is the problem with the personal documents of hundreds of individuals being available online, accessible by anyone with an internet connection. See, dear UIDAI, the problem would seem a problem to you if you werenâ€™t so intent on denying everything that has the words â€œAadhaarâ€ and â€œleakâ€ in the same sentence. UIDAI tweeted, â€œAadhaar as an identity document by its very nature needs to be shared openly with others as and when required and asked for.â€ Dear UIDAI, nobody is refuting that. But thereâ€™s a difference between an individual providing his Aadhaar details when needed versus an organisation divulging them online. Among the nine tweets in UIDAIâ€™s vehement denial, the most absurd one has to be the sixth tweet. The UIDAI claims, â€œBy simply knowing someoneâ€™s Aadhaar, no one can impersonate & harm him because Aadhaar alone is not sufficient, it requires biometrics to authenticate oneâ€™s Identity.â€ The following details of people were revealed online in the latest Aadhaar data leak. Phishing is the fraudulent practice of sending emails or making calls claiming to be from reputable companies in order to induce people to reveal their personal information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. The information obtained is then used to carry out credit card frauds, unauthorised transactions and the likes. So organisations like the AIFF and government body Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services are making the people, whose personal details they are divulging online, more vulnerable to online frauds and phishing. The UIDAIâ€™s final two tweets of denial use a clever choice of words to tell a half-truth. When the UIDAI claims, â€œthere has not been a single breach from its biometric database during that last eight years of its existenceâ€, it conveniently ignores two things. So for the UIDAI to boast that â€œAadhaar remains safe and secureâ€ by mentioning that â€œthere has not been a single breach from its biometric databaseâ€ is to quote information in a deliberately misleading manner. These non-biometric details include an individualâ€™s photograph, full name, parentâ€™s name, date of birth, email address, mobile number, gender and complete residential address. And as explained above, for reasons like the increased threat from phishing, such data leaks are a cause for concern, aside from the obvious privacy woes that arise. For the UIDAI to repeatedly brush away legitimate worries about data leaks does not bode well for the country. Their vehement denial to the latest data leak relies on half-truths and faulty reasoning to make its point â€“ that all is well with everyoneâ€™s Aadhaar data. Yet, as weâ€™ve explained in this point-by-point counter, the UIDAIâ€™s assurances seem to be, to use their own words, â€œfar from the reality.â€ (What does the first-time woman voter want?

44,The News Minute,"After Uproar, Stalin Backtracks on â€˜Welcomingâ€™ Dravida Nadu Demand - The Quint","In   to a question on the demand for Dravida Nadu, Leader of Opposition in the Tamil Nadu Assembly and DMK Working President MK Stalin said on Saturday, 17 March, â€œIf it (such a demand) comes up, it is to be welcomed. I hope it comes up.â€ However, a day later, MK Stalin clarified his statement to a mediaperson saying, â€œThe media is projecting as though I have demanded Dravida Nadu (and that is not true).â€ The Dravida Nadu refers to EVR Periyarâ€™s grand vision of the united states of south India. It was to include the populations that speak the Dravidian languages: Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam. However, CN Annadurai, a disciple of Periyar and a founder of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam(DMK), realised that even as independent India was defining its boundaries, it was less and less likely to realise the demand for unified southern states. Annadurai, who went onto become Chief Minister, gave up the demand for Dravida Nadu and chose to work within the existing Indian polity. Stalinâ€™s comments come in the light of growing discourse on the imposition of Hindi in the south and insulting Periyar, the founding father of the Dravidian movement. Earlier this month, the BJP came under fire for stoking violence and causing pandemonium in the state. A vitriolic post on BJP National Secretary H Rajaâ€™s Facebook regarding Dravidian icon EVR Periyarâ€™s statue was followed by acts of vandalism on Periyarâ€™s statue. A Periyarist group retaliated by cutting of holy threads of a few Brahmins in Chennai. Following the violence and protests, leaders in the state had condemned H Raja and the BJP. Many took to the streets to protest the saffron partyâ€™s politics in the state and called for the removal of H Raja from the party along with an apology from him. The Tamil Nadu government was severely criticised for saying that no action need be taken on H Raja given that he had deleted the post. Following the uproar on social media, the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister came up with a stronger condemnation of the events. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

45,Swaptik Chowdhury,India Desperately Needs a Comprehensive Law to Protect Its Beggars - The Quint,"The hopes of activists and the public, that the government would finally address the issue of abject poverty and exploitation of beggars was destroyed when the government decided to abandon the newly-modeled Beggar Rehabilitation Bill. But no movement was observed in the bill after its initial introduction and it was ultimately dropped. Meanwhile, beggars and destitutes were yet again rounded up by the police in Hyderabad before the visit of US President Donald Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka Trump in November 2017. Similar tactics were adopted when former US President Bill Clinton visited India in 2000. Beggary and homelessness is prevalent in India due to many reasons, chief among them being greater economic segregation and insufficient access to affordable and high-quality education. According to the 2011 Census, there are about 4.13 lakhs of beggars and homeless people in India, of which non-workers comprise approximately 90 percent and under-marginal workers comprise the remaining 10 percent. It was also reported that the 90 percent of the total reported vagrants (beggars and homeless people) are under the age of 14. It should be also noted that the data is approximately seven years old and the situation is bound to have worsened. Analysts argue that the condition is worsening due to lack of any comprehensive policy addressing the issue of beggary. The Indian Constitution under Article 21 guarantees right to life, which does not merely involve the act of breathing but also incorporates the right to live with dignity, with livelihood, with good health and all other aspects which make a human life meaningful and wholesome. Thus, as India is a social welfare state, it is the responsibility of the government to develop policies so that all its citizens can achieve that wholesome life. India is also part of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which has a provision for right to living with dignity, and the lack of any concrete policies to deal with the issue of beggary and homelessness is inconsistent with that provision. All the previous attempts of policy development pertaining to beggary have been enacted as anti-beggary laws at the state level. In India, there is a provision for some form of anti-beggary legislation or the other, in 22 states and union-territories. The most prominent of these individual provisions is the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act of 1959 which makes begging a serious offense which is compoundable and non-bailable. However, the current anti-beggary laws have a lot of shortcomings, which have made them practically ineffective and oppressive. These laws go with the â€œone size fits allâ€ solution for controlling beggary. Also, the current provisions and laws have a bias against beggars and the destitute as evident from the case  . Numerous other provisions such as arrest without warrant, guilty by association, etc. also depict this bias. Further, it should be noted that due to the complex factors associated with the prevalence of beggary in India, most of the laws were developed around addressing only the individual contributing factors. But such individual laws are not synchronised. For example, Juvenile Justice Act (Care and Protection of Children Act), 2015 identifies child beggars as â€œchild in need of care and protectionâ€, which clashes with the persecutive provision of Bombay Prevention of Begging Act. Thus, the dire need for a more comprehensive bill. It also proposed that the government should maintain centres to provide vocational training, counseling, etc. and should help in rehabilitating the destitute. Although the bill still left much to be desired, it was a huge improvement on the the generic anti-beggary laws. It had many progressive provisions, such as establishment of â€œoutreach and mobilisation unitâ€ to identity and recommend destitutes for rehabilitation, vocational training/skill development and other necessary rehabilitative services at care centres, creating a central fund which would supplement the fund of states for the rehabilitation program etc. Prime Minister Narendra Modi still has a chance to make history by reviving the bill and providing the world with a progressive blueprint to address this issue.

46,The Quint,Karnataka Govt Approves Separate Religion Status For Lingayats - The Quint,"Just months before the Karnataka Assembly election, the Siddaramaiah-led government on Monday, 19 March accepted the recommendation of Nagamohan Das Committee for a separate religion status for members of the Lingayat community. The committee, formed by the state government in December 2017 to decide on the matter, had noted that â€œLingayats may be considered as religious minority."" The state governmentâ€™s decision is a crucial political development ahead of the 2018 state assembly polls in Karnataka. Lingayats are traditionally considered to be a major components of the BJPâ€™s vote bank across the state, especially in north Karnataka bordering Maharashtra. Political analysts and the Opposition had accused the Congress of playing up the issue for electoral gains, according to  . An outcome of rebellion against Vedic rituals and casteist practices in the Hindu religion, the Lingayat sect was formed by 12th century social reformer Basavanna. His followers were taught to worship Shiva, in direct and personal manner, without any Brahminic practices. The progressive nature of the new sect attracted followers from across castes and communities. Over the centuries, following Basavannaâ€™s death, the Brahminic practices opposed by him found its way to the religion, leading to the merger of Lingayats and Veerashaivas. The word Lingayat was since used to represent both communities. However, the Karnataka cabinet is a divided house. Mondayâ€™s decision was taken after a 8 March meeting on the issue was deferred following a heated disagreement between Lingayat and Veerashaiva ministers in the cabinet. Water Resources Minister MB Patil and Higher Education Minister Basavaraj Rayareddi â€“ both Lingayats â€“ had argued in favour of going ahead with the committee report. However, they were strongly opposed by Municipal Administration Minister Eshwar Khandre and Horticulture Minister SS Mallikarjun. Mallikarjun is the son of All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha President Shamanur Shivashankarappa while Khandre has previously said that Veerashaivas and Lingayats should not be divided. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah intervened as the arguments escalated â€“ and decided to defer the matter. Former IAS officer SM Jamdaar, who is spearheading the Lingayat movement for a separate religion tag, challenged the Veerashaiva faction to produce historical documents. The movement for a separate religion tag, which was started as far back as 1942, was resurrected in 2017 by Siddaramaiahâ€™s promise to look into the demand for a separate religion status for Lingayats and Veerashaivas. In December 2017, a seven-member expert committee was formed to study five separate demands, three of which were for a separate minority religion status for Lingayats. One representation stated that the Lingayat community members are Hindus â€“ and another demanding minority religion tag for the Veerashaiva-Lingayat sect. In January 2018, the committee recommended â€œreligious minority tagâ€ for Lingayats. It concluded that there is enough evidence to differentiate Lingayat religion from Hindu religion, and added that Veerashaivas â€“ another sect looking to get religious minority status â€“ too can be part of the larger umbrella of â€˜Lingayat religionâ€™, as per a report by  . A court case related to the issue in the Karnataka High Court is still being heard. The court had earlier put a rider on the process initiated by the Karnataka government on the formation of the panel and its report â€“ and said that further steps will be subject to the courtâ€™s final decision.

47,Aviral Virk,What is Rahul Gandhiâ€™s Narrative at the Congress Plenary?,"At the 1998 All India Congress Committee plenary, Sonia Gandhiâ€™s election as Congress President was ratified. Electorally, the party was at its lowest, having lost two consecutive elections and reduced to its lowest strength in the Lok Sabha with 144 MPs. It was in power in only a few states including â€“ Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Internally, the party leadership was fragmented. Even after Sitaram Kesariâ€™s controversial exit, other senior leaders were yet to fully accept Sonia Gandhiâ€™s leadership, ostensibly because of her foreign origins. In 2017, the AICC plenary will ratify her son, Rahul Gandhiâ€™s election as party president. Electorally, the party is at its lowest point after the 2014 general election â€“ reduced to only 49 MPs in the Lok Sabha. After losing Meghalaya and Assam, the Congress is reduced to power in only three states â€“ Karnataka, Punjab and Mizoram and one union territory - Pondicherry. Internally, the party struggles to strike a balance between the ambitions of the old and the new guard, continues to be outsmarted by the BJPâ€™s ground-level organisation skills and outshouted by its media campaigns. It took Sonia Gandhi six years before she could lead the party to a election victory in 2004. With less than a year to go for the 2019 general election, the AICC plenary gives fair view of the message that the Congress is trying to send to its party workers and the Opposition. For the first time in the history of the Indian National Congress, the stage on which the party leadership sits has been done away with. The attempt is to give out a message of equality to the party worker, who did not have a say so far. On Day 2 of the plenary, Rahul Gandhi, in his opening remarks acknowledged Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaraiamaiah as leaders whoâ€™ve helped â€œfight the battle of the Congressâ€ and â€œprotecting its symbolâ€. Rahul Gandhi, in his opening remarks on Day 2 of the AICC plenary, said: In a sharp contrast to previous plenary sessions, Gandhi kept his opening remarks short and repeatedly accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of being â€œautocraticâ€. By positioning himself as a more tolerant leader who allowed more room to his leaders than himself, Gandhi will be hoping to set a counter-narrative to Modiâ€™s â€˜one man showâ€™. However, United Progressive Alliance Chairperson Sonia Gandhi tore into the Modi government, accusing it of being â€œarrogant and power hungry.â€ She accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of working towards a â€œ â€ instead of advancing the country and said that the promises of "" â€ and "" "" by the current government is nothing but â€œdramaâ€ and their tactics to get votes. The Congress is leveraging the TDP-BJP divorce by drawing a comparison to the â€œdinner diplomacyâ€ displayed by UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi last week. â€œUPAâ€™s dining table is getting bigger, NDAâ€™s walls are getting higherâ€, is how Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill described the political developments. In its political resolution, released on Saturday, the Congress mentioned that it was Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh who had announced the award in Special Category Status of Andhra Pradesh in Parliament on 20 February 2014 and that the party was â€œdismayed that till the date, the implementation of the special category status has not been given effect to and that even the benefits to the State announced in the AP Reorganisation Act have been diluted or not implementedâ€. Further, it condemned the â€œneglectâ€ and â€œinjusticeâ€ to the state of Andhra Pradesh by the current BJP-led government and reiterated its commitment to the complete implementation of the PMâ€™s assurances and the provision of the AP Reorganisation Act, and Special Category Status to Andhra Pradesh.

To mark the occasion, CM Yogi Adityanath released a film ""  and a booklet highlighting his government's achievements.

The sprawling Lok Bhawan, which was incidentally constructed during the tenure of previous Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, was dotted by drum-beating and conch-shell blowing folk artistes in colourful costumes. Welcoming the guests, Deputy CM Maurya said that the government's first year has been memorable on many terms, as it had not only succeeded in creating an atmosphere of security and safety in the state but also successfully held an investorsâ€™ summit, besides waiving off loans of poor farmers. He also thanked the state BJP's Secretary, Organisation, Sunil Bansal, terming him the architect of the BJP's success in the state.

49,Thubten Samphel,Why Tibetans Shouldnâ€™t Be Offended by Indiaâ€™s Snub to Dalai Lama - The Quint,"When you thank a person for his or her hospitality or a favour done or courtesy shown to you, that personâ€™s usual and expected response is â€œYou are most welcome.â€ In the lead-up to a major year-long Thank You India event to commemorate 60 years in exile and to take place across India and organised by the Central Tibetan Administration, the government of Indiaâ€™s response seems to be â€œWe donâ€™t want your thank you.â€ As  , the cabinet secretary of the union government issued a circular advising central and state leaders and officials not to attend any â€˜Thank You, Indiaâ€™ event. The Central Tibetan Administration was advised to move the highlight of the event from New Delhi to Dharamsala. This is the trending topic among Tibetans on social media. Tibetans have expressed their disappointment, suspecting a shift in the attitude of the government of India to the Tibetan cause. In fact, Indiaâ€™s diplomatic tip-toeing around the issue of Tibet should not distract the Tibetan refugees from the Indian governmentâ€™s massive, consistent and unstinting support to them. With Indiaâ€™s support and under the Dalai Lamaâ€™s guidance, the Tibetan refugees have been able to establish a productive and cohesive community serviced by schools, settlements, hospitals, clinics, old peopleâ€™s homes, monasteries and higher learning centres, all centrally or autonomously supervised by the Central Tibetan Administration. More importantly, Indiaâ€™s tolerance and hospitality has given space to Tibetan refugees to re-energise and revitalise the institutions, values and disciplines of Tibetâ€™s Buddhist heritage. This ability to re-establish Tibetâ€™s cultural and spiritual heritage in India has attracted students and scholars from areas which once came within the ambit of Tibetâ€™s Buddhist civilisation. The Dalai Lamaâ€™s tireless travel and his message of peace and compassion have drawn new students and scholars to India from across the world. Some scholars call the ability of Tibetan refugees to plant the roots of cultural Tibet in India â€œone of the miracles of the twentieth century.â€ As for the government of Indiaâ€™s policy to Tibet is concerned, that was settled in 1954. That year, India and China signed the Panchsheel agreement in which India recognised Tibet as an autonomous part of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China. Against this historical background, how the government of India will continue to view the exile community will depend on the Tibetan refugees themselves.

50,Manoj Joshi,Indiaâ€™s Stance on Dalai Lama Reveals Dynamics With China - The Quint,"At first sight, there is nothing wrong with Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhaleâ€™s request to the Cabinet Secretary requesting him to send out a directive asking senior government officials to stay away from events aimed at marking the start of the Dalai Lamaâ€™s 60th year of exile, in particular a large public event in New Delhi on 1 April. The foreign secretaryâ€™s letter was sent on the eve of his visit to Beijing on 22 February. He noted that the coming months were a â€œvery sensitive timeâ€ for bilateral relations. This June, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Qingdao in China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. But unconfirmed reports suggest that the Prime Minister may make an official visit as early as April. That would explain the ""sensitive time"" point. The reality of how India has dealt with the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan refugees is more nuanced. The Modi government, in particular, has not been above using the Tibetans and the Dalai Lama as instruments for signalling its own China policy. In 2014, among the guests to Prime Minister Modiâ€™s inauguration was the Sikyong or head of the Tibetan government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay. Last year, in the midst of the Doklam standoff, India permitted Sangay to hoist the Tibetan flag on the shores of the Pangong Tso lake on the border with Tibet in Ladakh. On both issues, instead of quiet diplomacy, New Delhi chose to try and shame Beijing with strong public statements that put the latterâ€™s back up. Later in 2017, the two sides had their most serious border confrontation, but one which involved Chinese transgression of the Sino-Bhutanese border at Doklam. New Delhi was   above using the Dalai Lamaâ€™s access to signal its displeasure with Beijing. In December 2016, the Dalai Lama visited the Rashtrapati Bhavan and shared a dais with the president on a function to honour Nobel laureates. Early in 2017, the Dalai Lama was permitted to visit Tawang, the first time since 2009. What infuriated Beijing was that he was received by Chief Minister Pema Khandu and the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju. The man who dealt with these issues as the Indian Ambassador in Beijing was Gokhale himself, and he is keenly aware as to how bad relations with China have led to an imbalance in Indiaâ€™s global posture. Ever since he became foreign secretary, there has been an effort to restore some equilibrium both in the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle-East. Given the Dalai Lamaâ€™s status as the temporal and religious authority of Tibet, when he came away to India, his government ministers accompanied him, and so the establishment was, in a sense, a Tibetan government-in-exile, though it was formally called the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) of His Holiness the Dalai Lama. The terms used by the Tibetans for their council of ministers in Lhasa, Kashag, is still used, and its leader, the Kalon Tripa, served under the Dalai Lama. In 2011, the Dalai Lama gave up his temporal authority and the political authority was transferred to the Kalon Tripa, whose title was changed to Sikyong, currently Lobsang Sangay, who functions as the president of the CTA. But the title was the same as regents took when the Dalai Lama was a minor. In his very first meeting with Dalai Lama after his escape and exile in India in April 1959, Nehru made it clear that he could not act as the head of a government in exile in India. Since then, India has allowed Tibetans to protest against visiting Chinese leaders, it has encouraged Tibetan leaders to make their political statements outside the country, but it has also allowed the CTA to function. Whatever may have been Chinese intentions when they signed the 17-Point Agreement, they changed by 1959. Perhaps spooked by a CIA covert war against them in Tibet, they cracked down with great brutality and the Dalai Lama was lucky to manage his escape from Tibet. Over the years, the Chinese have, at times, reached out to the Dalai Lama, and at times termed him a â€œdangerous separatistâ€, â€œdemonâ€, â€œsplittistâ€ and a â€œwolf in sheepâ€™s clothing.â€ So extreme is the Chinese view that they have even declared that his reincarnation should be as per Chinese instructions and subject to their approval. They believe that his visits to Tawang may be a prelude for his reincarnation to take place there in the famous monastery which had been established in accordance with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama in 1680. As Chinese power has grown, so has their ability to ensure that the Dalai Lama is not received by any foreign leader. Today, only the Americans are willing to meet him; his last meeting with President Obama being in June 2016. Despite everything, Prime Minister Modi is yet to have had an official meeting with Dalai Lama. Discretion, it is said, is sometimes the better part of valour.

51,The Quint,Ashraf Sehrai to Replace Geelani as Tehreek-e-Hurriyat Chairman - The Quint,"Tehreek-e-Hurriyat elected Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai as its chairman on 19 March, replacing Syed Ali Shah Geelani. Sehrai was elected chairman of the Tehreek-e-Hurriyat at a meeting of its executive committee after Geelani decided to step down, sources in the separatist party said. Geelani will, however, continue to head the hardline faction of the Hurriyat Conference of which Tehreek-e-Hurriyat is a constituent, the sources said. Geelani had been under the lens of the National Investigative Agency, which is probing terror financing cases in Jammu and Kashmir. The hardline separatist leader on Friday, 16 March, rejected the offer for talks by the Centreâ€™s special representative on sustained dialogue in Kashmir, Dineshwar Sharma. Political observers in Kashmir believe that Sehrai will ultimately succeed 88-year-old Geelani as the head of the Hurriyat Conference. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

52,Reuters,Republicans to Trump: Let Mueller Do His Job in Russia Probe - The Quint,"Republican senators warned President Donald Trump on Sunday, 18 March, not to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and said the president must let federal investigators looking into Russian meddling in the US election do their jobs. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who has criticised Trump harshly, said the president's latest comments appeared to be aimed at the firing of Mueller. Senator Lindsey Graham, another Republican, said if Trump were to dismiss Mueller, it would mark ""the beginning of the end of his presidency."" AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, said: ""As the speaker has always said, Mr Mueller and his team should be able to do their job."" In an effort to tamp down the chatter, White House lawyer Ty Cobb issued a statement on the night of 18 March saying that Trump was not weighing Mueller's removal. The Republican comments underscored the risks for Trump if he goes too far to thwart the federal probe. In a series of tweets over the weekend, Trump accused the FBI leadership of lies, corruption and leaking information. He called the Russia probe a politically motivated witch hunt. ""I don't know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that (firing him), and I just hope it doesn't go there, because it can't. We can't in Congress accept that,"" Flake said on CNN's â€˜State of the Union.â€™ ""So I would expect to see considerable pushback in the next couple of days urging the president not to go there."" On Saturday, Trump's personal lawyer John Dowd urged the Justice Department official overseeing Mueller, Rod Rosenstein, to ""bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey.""

Mukherjeeâ€™s name features prominently on the â€˜Hall of Fameâ€™ board along with other alumni of the college, including Swami Vivekananda, Dipesh Chakroborty, Air Marshall Subroto Mukherjee, Sisir Kumar Mitra, Srikumar Banerjee. Earlier in March, members of a left-wing student organisation allegedly vandalised a bust of Mukherjee and blackened its face in the Keoratola crematorium. Six people were detained by the police in connection with the incident. Hours after the assembly election results of Tripura were announced on 3 March, a statue of the communist icon Vladimir Lenin was bulldozed by a group of right wing supporters in the stateâ€™s Belonia town, triggering a series of attacks on statues of political leaders. Following the vandalism on Leninâ€™s statue, a Dravidian leader Periyarâ€™s statue was vandalised in Tamil Nadu as well. Statues of BR Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi were also not spared.

55,Ravi Joshi,â€˜How Democracies Dieâ€™ â€“ Lessons for India? - The Quint,"The emergence of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the US in 2016 has provoked several books on the (sorry) state of American democracy and the crises it faces. â€˜How Democracies Dieâ€™ is authored by two Political Scientists from Harvard, Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, is perhaps the most relevant book not only for America but for democracies in general â€“ and for India in particular. Warning that â€œDemocratic backsliding today begins at the ballot box,â€ they state that successful functioning of a democracy depends on various institutional checks and balances enshrined in the Constitution, strictly adhered by political parties and overseen by a watchful judiciary. The authors argue that political parties have to maintain â€˜mutual tolerationâ€™ â€“ or that competing parties accept one another as legitimate rivals â€“ and â€˜forbearanceâ€™ or the idea that politicians should exercise restraint in deploying their institutional prerogatives. One of the most important contributions of this book is a checklist of indices of an authoritarian leadership. We find, quite unsurprisingly, that Modi and the present BJP leadership tick all the boxes. Remember Anant Kumar Hegde? Other senior leaders are not so blatant but have often expressed reservations on the â€˜secularâ€™ clause inserted in the Preamble. Repeated calls for amending the Constitution in order to hold one-time National elections for both the Parliament and State Assemblies, thereby undermining the Federal nature of the Indian polity. Obstructing the functioning of a democratically elected government in the State of Delhi, because an Opposition party rules it. Bending the Election Commission to postpone the date of polls in Gujarat till PM Modi inaugurated the Narmada Dam and announced more sops to the people of the state. Use of money power to buy up MLAs where the BJP was in a minority to gain power as in the case of Goa, Meghalaya and Nagaland. Meghalaya is a classic case where the BJP with only two MLAs managed to stitch together a ruling coalition. The Congress Party too in the past indulged in a similar game of thwarting popular mandate through money power, but the game has now reached a new order of magnitude. No such attempt has been made, but several opposition parties questioned the use of EVMs to rig the ballot. This needs further proof.  Bharat is a stated objective of PM Modi. The Opposition is often painted as anti-development and anti-progress. Repeated assertions that nothing good has been done to the country in the last 70 years and that the first PM Pandit Nehru is the root cause of all that is wrong in the country today. All the corruption and evils of last 70 years blamed on one party â€“ the Congress â€“ which is therefore held unfit to rule. No serious attempt is made to investigate their corruption and penalise the guilty. Sonia Gandhi, former President of Congress Party is often accused of being a foreign agent, because of her Italian birth, though she is a full -fledged Indian citizen. Letâ€™s take a look at the RSS, VHP, Rama Sene, Hindu Sene, Karni Sena etc. This was supported by several ministers and leaders in about 6 BJP ruling States. PM Modiâ€™s long and deafening silence on lynch mobs, repeated refusal to condemn the killers of Gauri Lankesh; instead following on the Twitter a person who gloated over her killing. BJP leaders have often endorsed violence on Muslims by their lynch mobs either by underplaying it or by justifying it. PM Modiâ€™s refusal to condemn or regret the violence on Muslims in Gujarat in 2002 and his more recent refusal to condemn the violence of Rohingya refugees in Myanmar in 2017. In both cases, the victims are Muslims. Use of the most dreaded â€˜Sedition Actâ€™ on protest speeches by a few students of JNU, basing them on doctored CDs. Dismissal of a Dalit Research scholar from the rolls of the Central University Hyderabad for demanding restoration of his scholarship grant, leading to his suicide. The arrest and continued detention of Karti Chidambaram, son of former Finance Minister P Chidambaram, on charges that are yet to be proven. Filing of a Rs 100 crore defamation suit against an online news site â€˜The Wireâ€™ for publishing an article against Jay Shah, son of BJP President Amit Shah. Repeated criminal cases against Human Rights Lawyer Teesta Setalvad, who is fighting for justice for the victims of communal violence in Gujarat in 2002.) They greatly admire his success in building up a powerful state of Germany that emerged from the ruins of the First World War. Now Israel and PM Benjamin Netanyahu are the role models for their ruthless suppression of the Palestinians. Both in the US and India, the guardrails of democracy have been breached. The trends are dangerous and worrying. â€˜Saving Democracyâ€™ is the last chapter in the book that has many useful lessons for all democracies. It is a compelling book for our troubled times.

56,Chandan Nandy,Review: A Dive Into Pakistanâ€™s Deep State & Americaâ€™s Longest War - The Quint,"Well into its first 200 pages, celebrated American journalist-writer-professor Steve Collâ€™s book  ,   offers a gripping account of the combined might of the USâ€™ security agencies, at war with al Qaeda and the Taliban. In Collâ€™s polite words, barring the elimination of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on 1 May 2011 (which was the result of an air-tight and well-executed operation by the CIA), the US National Counter Terrorism Centre and White Houseâ€™s policies in restoring peace on war-ravaged Afghanistan, were â€œriddled with such internal contradictions and unresolved analytical questions (that) failed to achieve the extraordinarily ambitious aim of stabilising war-shattered Afghanistanâ€¦ It became a story of mismatched means and ends.â€ Moreover,   also goes into the heart of the Pakistani security establishment, chiefly the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Not many American writers have delved so deep into Pakistanâ€™s â€œdeep stateâ€ like Coll has. It appears that as an unbiased observer and chronicler of the so-called war that America waged on the Taliban and al Qaeda, Coll leaves behind an impression â€“ that while considered to be perfidious in its ways â€“ the Pakistani intelligence agency (ISI) was a â€œformidable adversaryâ€ of the US. From the tenure of Pervez Musharraf, first as the Pakistan Army Chief of Staff and then as the countryâ€™s military dictator, to General Ashfaq Qayani and General Ahmed Shuja Pasha, Collâ€™s narrative accounts, complete with full quotations of several of the actors American, Pakistani and Afghan, over a 15-year-period, is breathtaking and awe-inspiring. While  , in large part, connects many seemingly disparate stories into a wholesome narrative, it reveals how India remained a bit player in the high-stakes war in Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to Coll, Pakistanâ€™s extreme levels of suspicions of Indiaâ€™s intentions in Afghanistan after the so-called â€˜fall of the Talibanâ€™ in 2001, was fueled by the ISIâ€™s own running and backing of terrorism against India. Immediately after 9/11, the ISI successfully kept the US at bay from bringing India into the security matrix over Afghanistan. Coll goes back to the 26 November 2008 terror strikes in Mumbai â€“ â€œa Hollywood-inspired terrorist extravaganzaâ€ â€“ in some detail, which convinced the US about the massive threat posed by ISI-backed-and-supported terrorists in South Asia. But the US still hedged its bets on Pakistan as an ally in its war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, especially in the CIAâ€™s unrelenting hunt for bin Laden. However, the brushes of cooperation between Indian and American security agencies did foster the semblance of trust between the two countries, though the Indian establishment continued to remain ambivalent about partnering wholly with its US counterparts. Here too,   reflects the depths of Collâ€™s reach within the Pakistani, American and Afghan establishments. Collâ€™s conclusion on the ISI-al Qaeda relationship is summed up in a brief paragraph in which he says that â€œCIA and other Obama administration officials have said they possess no evidenceâ€¦ that Kayani and Pasha or any other ISI officer knew where bin Laden was hiding. Given the hostility toward Pakistan prevalent in American national security bureaucracy by 2011, if the United States possessed such hard evidence, it almost certainly would have leakedâ€. The CIA would listen in on most phone conversations between the topmost officers of the Pakistani military and intelligence establishments, including Kayani and Pasha. In one instance, Coll exposes how â€œintercepts of phone conversations between Kayani and Pasha after the Abbottabad raid had them sounding surprised about Bin Ladenâ€™s whereabouts â€“ or pretending to be surprised â€“ but also captured them expressing envy.â€ Despite being a high-value target, Omar had escaped assassination by drone-guided missiles, but resurfaced in 2013 as a dead man â€“ who fell prey to a kidney ailment â€“ in a Karachi hospital. Coll acknowledges, and rightly so, that for all the efforts that the US put into resolving the Afghan imbroglio, its â€œfailure to solve the riddle of ISI and to stop its covert interference in Afghanistan became, ultimately, the greatest strategic failure of the American warâ€. More importantly, the Bush administrationâ€™s needless involvement in Iraq certainly deflected its attention from Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Bush and Obama administrations, with their multiple agencies and waves of new officials and so-called specialists who occupied sensitive positions between 2001 and 2016, worked with little cooperation among themselves. They â€œinterpreted White House policy memos liberallyâ€, and sometimes so divergently, that their actions, howsoever genuine, caused a means-and-ends â€œmismatchâ€, leading ultimately to the failure in establishing a stable government in Kabul. The â€œmachineâ€ was not geared to install and run good governments in â€œdeeply impoverished, violent landscapes or to win asymmetric conflictsâ€. What Coll, however, forgets is that America has always had a history of mismanaging crises emanating from its own policy botch-ups across many theatres of global violence.

57,The Quint,Yogi Govt Focused on Temples Instead of the Poor: BJP Ally Rajbhar - The Quint,"As the Yogi Adityanath-led government turns a year old, an ally of the ruling party has gone public with his criticism of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),   reported on 19 March. Om Prakash Rajbhar, chief of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party alleged that the BJP in Uttar Pradesh has merely focused on temples instead of the poor, with little change on ground. A minister in the UP cabinet, Rajbhar said that the BJP did not consult his party before choosing its candidates for the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls despite the presence of the partyâ€™s four legislators in the UP assembly,   reported. Rajbhar also warned that the ruling BJP ""will lose elections"" if the government doesn't mend its ways. After a major blow in the bypolls, the BJP's biggest ally in the south, the Telugu Desam Party of Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu, withdrew its support and decided to push a no-confidence move in parliament. Taking cue, Rajbhar accused the party of not following the coalition drama in Uttar Pradesh. Although Rajbhar skipped the one-year celebrations, for now, he is not pulling out of the alliance. Recently, union minister Ram Vilas Paswan, advised the party to learn from its crushing defeat in UP bypolls and ""mend its image."" Rajbhar, is the second ally to openly express his disenchantment with the BJP, the NDTV report added. Meanwhile, Siddharth Nath Singh, a BJP minister in the state, said Rajbhar should not go public with his problems when he is in alliance with the party, the Scroll report added.

58,Ashutosh,Akhilesh-Mayawati Victory Teaches Opposition: â€˜United We Riseâ€™ - The Quint,"There is an old slogan â€”  This slogan did the rounds in 1993, when Uttar Pradesh was due for Assembly Elections. At the time, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Kanshiram had reached an understanding, and had decided to contest the elections together. The Babri Masjid had been pulled down. LK Advani was at the helm in BJP. In UP, Kalyan Singh was the â€œHindu Hriday Samratâ€ (emperor of Hindu hearts) and wielded a significant amount of influence. After the demolition of the Babri Masjid, the BJP government had been shown the door. Elections were going on and the BJP was confident about its victory. But the Mulayam-Kanshiram alliance changed the equation â€“ just like today, when the Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati alliance changed the game in the UP by-elections for Gorakhpur and Phulpur, by winning both seats. In 1993 too, BJP had lost the election. The slogan proved to be true. Mandal politics got the upper hand over Kamandal politics. Even the war cry of â€˜Jai Shree Ramâ€™ couldnâ€™t save the BJP. The election results of Gorakhpur and Phulpur are interesting in many ways. BJPâ€™s UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has won the Gorakhpur seat the last five times. Before him, Mahant Adityanath had won thrice from that seat. Meaning, since the â€˜Ram Mandirâ€™ issue came up, the BJP has   lost the seat. But a senior BJP member had told me that he (Yogi) was leader of the future. I did not agree with him. At the very least, this was a shock for the people of UP. At the beginning, TV news channels focused so much on Yogi, that for a while even Modi was pushed off the screen. The Sangh Pariwar and BJP always thought that after Kalyan Singh, they had no other leader in the region of his stature who could secure a win for the party on his own. Rajnath Singh is a big leader but the party wants him at the Centre. He also doesnâ€™t want to get caught up in regional politics. The Sanghâ€™s assessment was that without winning UP, Delhi canâ€™t be won, and the   cannot be created. This is the reason why Modi was made to contest the election from Benaras. After the UP Assembly victory, the dream to make Yogi into the next Kalyan Singh was visualised. Just like Kalyan Singh, Yogi is also immersed in the Sanghâ€™s â€˜Hindutva coloursâ€™. Yogi started showing his true colours soon after becoming chief minister. Meat sellers began to be terrorised by  Everyone knew that   was just an excuse, and the real target was the Muslim community. Then began the â€˜love jihadâ€™ attacks and the formation of the â€˜Romeo Squadâ€™. Soon, encounter killings started to take place; around 40 such killings took place on Yogiâ€™s watch. Now, if a leader like that is unable to deliver a victory from his home base, how will he ever fulfill the Sanghâ€™s dreams? This question will definitely be asked now. The Phulpur seat was Keshav Prasad Mauryaâ€™s. He has been state party chief and is currently the Deputy Chief Minister. Being quite active in the Vishva Hindu Parishad, he has no qualms about being identified as a â€˜Hindutvavadiâ€™. But Maurya also failed. This is just one angle to the UP results. The real picture is much deeper, the source of which can be traced back to 1993. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Mayawati didnâ€™t win anything. Samajwadi Party managed to get five seats with difficulty. The BJP coalition won 73 seats. In 2017, Mayawatiâ€™s position became even weaker and she only managed to get 18 MLAs in the Assembly. Samajwadi Party also shrunk to 48 seats. So, what happened in just a year that the BJP couldnâ€™t save the base of two of its senior leaders? Actually, this story is more about Indian society than Indian politics. The upper castes have dominated for thousands of years, to the detriment of Dalit and other backward castes. After the Mandal Commission came into effect, the fight of the backward castes became stronger. Along with equality before the law, they also began participating in power politics in proportion to their population. Yogi didnâ€™t merely describe the Akhilesh Yadav-Mayawati alliance as a â€˜saanp-chuchunderâ€™ (snake-shrew) merger for the sake of it. It points to a deeply entrenched ideology. In numbers, the Dalit and Backward Castes form 80 percent of Hindu society, while the Upper Castes form 20 percent. Democracy is a numbers game. The one who has more people, has more power. Whenever there is a fight between 80 and 20, 20 will have to lose. But this will only happen when the 80 come together. With SP and BSP coming together as a united front, the BJPâ€™s head was left spinning. A one-time senior BJP leader Govindacharya calls it â€˜social engineering.â€™ This time, this social engineering worked. This â€˜social engineeringâ€™ will prove to be the biggest obstacle in Modiâ€™s path. If Mayawati and Akhilesh stay together, then irrespective of what Modi does, the BJP collation wonâ€™t be able to get 73 seats as they did in 2014. And if that happens, then it will be near impossible for the BJP to reach the required majority in the Lok Sabha. So, the story comes back to the point, â€˜ The Akhilesh-Mayawati alliance has the power to change the countryâ€™s politics. It can eclipse Modiâ€™s second term. This alliance also sends a message to the Opposition that if everyone unites, then Modi can be stopped and the RSS dream of making India a â€˜Hindu Rashtraâ€™ can also be prevented. But the million dollar question is: will the Opposition accept and realise this, and will Modi refrain from using government machinery to break this understanding? Will the Opposition have the capacity and mental strength to counter Modiâ€™s tactics? The game has just begun.       (What does the first-time woman voter want?

59,The Quint,Bhagwant Mann Resigns: Quits AAP After Kejriwalâ€™s Apology to Majithia,"Two days after the Aam Aadmi Partyâ€™s Punjab chief resigned from his post, 10 party members along with state unit leaders, met Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia in Delhi on Sunday, 18 March, to smoothen ruffled feathers within the party. The meeting comes after Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann on Friday, 16 March, resigned as the Aam Aadmi Party's Punjab chief, a day after party supremo Arvind Kejriwal's apology to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia drew flak from state unit leaders. Mann announced his decision to resign on Twitter. At Sundayâ€™s meeting, the chief minister is said to have to have given an explanation behind his apology to Majithia. According to party sources, the Punjab AAP MLAs present in the meeting are believed to have been convinced with Kejriwal's explanation. ""Anyhow, it rules out any split in the party in Punjab, as of now. Forming a separate group or splitting the party would require the consent of two-third of the 20 AAP MLAs,"" the sources said. Among the prominent absentees were Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, Sukhpal Singh Khaira and Bhagwant Mann, AAP MP from Sangrur. There have been different demands by the AAP MLAs and party leaders from Punjab after Kejriwal's apology letter went public, ranging from giving them more autonomy to forming a different group in protest. Aman Arora, AAP MLA from Suna, who had attended the meeting said there was some ""miscommunicationâ€. Arora said the AAP MLAs present in the meeting were convinced with the explanation given by Kejriwal as the legal battle was draining him and the party in terms of resources. This, he said, was also consuming the party supremo's time which could be used for focusing on governance in Delhi. Delhi Chief Minister Kejriwal had on Thursday, 15 March, tendered an apology to former Punjab minister Majithia for levelling charges of involvement in drugs trade against him. Kejriwal had apologised to Majithia through a formal letter. Majithia had filed a defamation case against the AAP chief and others after the latter made the allegation while campaigning ahead of the Punjab Assembly elections. The party has accumulated over 20 defamation cases till date, according to a   report. ""I hereby withdraw all my statements and allegations made against you and apologise for the same"", Kejriwal said in the letter, adding that he has now learnt that the allegations were ""unfounded"" and the damage caused to Majithia's esteem and the loss caused to him was regretted. SAD leader and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal lashed out at Kejriwal on Friday, 16 March, accusing him of cheap politics. Former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said he is happy that those fighting for truth have won. Soon after Kejriwalâ€™s apology, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, AAP leader and the Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, tweeted that the Delhi chief minister did not consult other party members. Another AAP leader from Punjab condemned Kejriwalâ€™s apology. Kumar Vishwas took a jibe at Kejriwal, and accused him of not standing by his words. Quoting sources, NDTV reported that Kejriwal is planning to apologise to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, too, for alleging his involvement in corrupt practices during Jaitleyâ€™s tenure as the head of the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). In August 2016, Kejriwal had also apologised to a BJP leader from Haryana, Avtar Singh Bhadana, for calling him â€œcorruptâ€ back in 2014, added NDTV. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

60,The Quint,Rahulâ€™s Speech Was the â€˜Rhetoric of a Loserâ€™: BJP Lambasts Cong - The Quint,"Taking a dig at Rahul Gandhi's remarks at the Congress's plenary session, the BJP on Sunday, 18 March, said that the party which questioned the ""fundamental existence"" of Lord Ram now wants to be identified with the Pandavas. Giving a point-by-point rebuttal of Gandhi's speech, senior BJP leader and Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman termed his address as the ""rhetoric of a loser"" and ""devoid of substance."" Recalling the two warring sides of the epic Mahabharat, Gandhi had said the BJP, like the Kauravas, fought for power, while his party, on the lines of the Pandavas, battled for truth. ""The party which questioned the fundamental existence of Shri Ram today wants to identify itself with Pandavas,"" Sitharaman said. ""I have never heard of a â€˜Congress' priest and a â€˜BJP' priest, but Rahul Gandhi has narrated a whole story on that, just a way to mock Hindus and Hinduism,"" she said. Earlier in the day, Gandhi had narrated a story about his meeting and conversation with priests during his visit to a temple. Taking on Gandhi over his attempt to link Modi with fugitives Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi, she termed it as ""a fake narrative"". Hitting back at Gandhi over his attack on Amit Shah, Sitharaman said that it was astonishing that the Congress president chooses to make allegations against the BJP chief even though he has been cleared by a court. ""Gandhi himself is out on bail in the Herald case, whereas our party President Amit Shah  , has been cleared by court,"" she said. On Gandhi's remarks on independence of the judiciary and the media during the Modi government's tenure, Sitharaman wondered from when the Congress became the protector of the judiciary. ""Do I need to remind how Indira Gandhi treated the judiciary when one verdict went against her. Rajiv Gandhi in 1988, almost brought a bill to curtail the freedom of the press. ""Indira Gandhi blacked out the media during the Emergency. And the grandson is talking about the freedom of the press,"" she said. Reacting to senior Congress leader P Chidambaram's jibe at the RBI that it should learn to count money from Hundi collectors in Tirupati, Sitharaman said, ""The RBI should hire the Congress for counting black money, as they are familiar with counting it."" On Gandhi's charges against Narendra Modi and the BJP-led government at the Centre, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the Congress president should apologise for his party's misdeeds first and then attack the prime minister. ""While accusing the Modi government he forgets that the Congress did the worst of genocide of Sikhs. They brought media censorship and are known for all kinds of corruption and scams. He should first apologise for all these,"" he said. Launching a scathing attack on the Congress President after he accused the BJP of imposing Hindi on Tamil Nadu, party state president Tamilisai Soundarajan asked Gandhi to â€˜recall the loss of Tamil lives in Sri Lankaâ€™. Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan too lashed out at Gandhi for comparing PM Narendra Modi to Nirav Modi. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

61,Aviral Virk,"Congress Plenary: Strategy Set, But Infighting Biggest Challenge","In the aftermath of the Congressâ€™ humiliating defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the Congress struggled to find a counter-narrative to the BJPâ€™s â€˜Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikasâ€™ pitch. By referring to the Mahabharata, the Congress president has attempted to equate the 2019 election as a war between the â€œdrunk on powerâ€ BJP and the â€œdesigned to fight for truthâ€ Congress. Rahul Gandhiâ€™s ideological pitch was also evident when he, early on in his speech, compared Gandhiâ€™s fight for freedom to Savarkarâ€™s plea for freedom. â€œThe soil of this nation is drenched in the blood of Congressmen and Congresswomenâ€, he said. â€œGandhiji died for India. India must never forget that when our leader was sleeping in jail, their leader, Savarkar, was writing a letter begging for mercy from the British. â€œThe BJP will accept a man accused of murder as their party president, but it will never be accepted in the Congress partyâ€, said Rahul Gandhi referring to, but without naming Amit Shah. In fact, by repeatedly raking up the Supreme Judgesâ€™ revolt over, among other things, the Judge Loya case and The Wireâ€™s report on the exponential growth in Amit Shahâ€™s son Jay Shahâ€™s wealth, the Congress seems adamant on settling into a routine with which to target PM Modiâ€™s closest aide. Apart from Shah, the Congress President also targeted Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and his daughter. â€œYou can steal Rs 33,000 crore from the banks and the BJP government will protect you. The Finance Minister will go silent because he and his daughter work for crony capitalists,"" he said. By uttering PM Modiâ€™s name in the same breath as Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi, the Congress president would be attempting to undermine the name that launched an electoral wave in favour of the BJP in 2014. Speaking of the three Modis in his concluding speech at the Plenary, Rahul Gandhi said â€“ â€œThe man who looted banks, Nirav Modi shares a similar name to the Prime Minister and the most corrupt man in cricket also shares the same name Modi. The name Modi symbolises the collusion between India's biggest crony capitalists and the Prime Minister of India.â€ While speaking about the BJPâ€™s failure to admit that demonetisation was a failure, Rahul said that unlike Modi, Congress was not afraid to admit to its mistakes. â€œCongress will take the country forward, but we are humans, we make mistakes. Modi ji thinks he is not human but an avatar of Godâ€, he said. Rahul Gandhi accused the Modi government of diverting the peopleâ€™s attention from its economic failures like demonetisation and inability to generate jobs. The Congress president said the Prime Minister had gone beyond the charade of mere â€˜jumlasâ€™ and had started peddling blatant lies to the people. â€œThereâ€™s demonetisation, Gabbar Singh Tax (GST), but he tells the people â€“ Lets do yoga. There are no jobs, farmers are committing suicide, but letâ€™s do yoga in front of India Gate. But the Congress cannot be stopped from seeking the truth and justiceâ€, he said. Expected to be more difficult than taking on Modi himself, affecting real change in the Congress is the biggest challenge for the party. To this effect, the Congress president announced that no longer will senior leaders be parachuted into a constituency and no longer will a hard-working party worker who may not have the money to fund his campaign, be denied a ticket to contest elections. The announcement was met with the loudest applause the 84th Congress plenary witnessed in its three days. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Although Nisha did not reveal the man's identity and the date of her journey in the book, Shone George, son of P C George, MLA, in a complaint on 17 March, alleged that she sought to paint him as the man who allegedly harassed her, through her memoir. In his complaint to the DGP, Shone said propaganda was being spread through social media targeting him following her allegation, and termed it a politically motivated move to defame him and his father in the public eye. Nisha mentions in her book that while waiting at the railway station a man introduced himself to her. Later, he sat next to her during the train journey and started talking. Nisha says in the book that she dropped polite hints that she was very sleepy but he paid no heed to her hints and ""went on and on.""

Interestingly, while Harsha has been asked for an explanation, Veerappa, the chief of the partyâ€™s manifesto committee, has not been asked for an explanation, although he had tweeted about it too. The tweet, which was deleted soon after it was posted on Thursday night, said, â€œINC needs to solve money politics.

However, the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the high commissioner would stay back for an indefinite period or ""until Indian agencies stop intimidating the staff and families of their diplomatic mission"" in New Delhi. ""In other words, Pakistan recalled its envoy to New Delhi as a protest till the situation improves,"" it reported. The official justified the move, insisting that under current circumstances it was not possible for the high commissioner to operate out of New Delhi. ""Children have never been harassed even when two countries have had the worst of relationship,"" he said. When asked whether Pakistan was contemplating withdrawing the families of its diplomatic staff, the official said it might have to if the current slide in the relationship was not arrested.

70,Vishnu Gopinath,"India, Pakistan Trade Allegations of Officials Being Harassed - The Quint","On Saturday, 17 March, the External Affairs Ministry complained to the Pakistan government that some Indian diplomats out for shopping in Islamabad claimed to have been aggressively followed and verbally abused. This is the second such incident in the last three days,   reported. An Indian diplomat and his family were chased by two men on a motorbike as they were on their way to a restaurant, on Thursday, 16 March, the report added. This was the 12th diplomatic communication from New Delhi on the subject this year, sources told NDTV. This comes a few days after Pakistan lodged complaints with the External Affairs Ministry alleging that Pakistani officials working in New Delhi have been subjected to intimidation and harassment, adding that it would pull back its officials if the incidents failed to stop. Pakistani media outlet  reported that Pakistani officials had approached the Indian External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi, as well as the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, alleging harassment by Indians in New Delhi. The Dawn report quotes an unnamed source as stating that in the past week, children of Pakistanâ€™s Deputy High Commissioner in New Delhi were allegedly stopped and harassed on their way to school. The report continues, quoting the source as stating that another incident took place in New Delhi where a senior Pak diplomat was allegedly harassed.  quoted Pakistani officials as claiming that as many as six incidents of Pakistani officials being harassed were reported in under three days. A senior Pakistani officialâ€™s car was stopped and the vehicle allegedly scratched, in Delhiâ€™s Chanakyapuri on 7 March, The Wire reported. A complaint was lodged with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) about the incident. A day later, on March 8, the Pakistani deputy high commissionerâ€™s vehicle was reportedly chased by a motorcycle and a car. The vehicle was ferrying the deputy high commissionerâ€™s children to school at the time, when it was reportedly stopped and abuses hurled at the children, The Wire added, quoting Pakistani sources. On the same day, the Pakistan high commissionâ€™s minister-politicalâ€™s car was also chased and scratched. Noting that the Pakistan High Commission has brought to the Ministry of External Affair's notice some incidents of alleged harassment over the last few days, sources within the MEA said these will no doubt be investigated, PTI reported. In more trouble, over the last few months, several Indian High Commission staffers have been severely harassed and intimidated, the source said to PTI, adding that in one case an official's home was broken into, and a laptop stolen. ""Aggressive surveillance, violation of physical space and tailing of officers in close and dangerous proximity is a perennial issue. Agency personnel keep shooting videos of the officers thrusting phones on their faces,â€ the source added to PTI. ""Obscene phone calls and messages are constantly received on phones. In view of such an atmosphere of intimidation, most families have returned to India and children have been withdrawn from schools,"" the source said.    an incident, where a group of men allegedly raided an Indian-owned residential complex in Islamabad, being constructed for Indian diplomats, last month and disconnected water and electricity supply, refusing to restore the supply for two weeks. However, sources said to PTI that India has repeatedly requested Pakistan to mutually ensure that High Commissions are allowed to do their job in an atmosphere free of harassment and intimidation, that staff be allowed to work and that construction projects get completed on time.

71,The Quint,Anil Vij Wants Removal of â€œSindhâ€ &â€œAdhinayakâ€ from AnthemÂ  - The Quint,"Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij demanded the removal of the word â€œ â€ from the Indian National anthem, as the word means â€œdictatorâ€, and allowing such a word the anthem would amount to praising a dictator in a democracy. â€œ  should also be removed (from the National Anthem). â€˜ â€™ means dictator, and in India, we donâ€™t have dictatorship but democracy.

73,PTI,"Despite Recent Losses, BJP Confident of Win in Maharashtra Bypolls - The Quint","Undeterred by setbacks in the recent by-elections in some states, the BJP is confident of retaining the Bhandara-Gondia and Palghar Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra, where bypolls are due. However, the Congress feels the recent bypoll results were an indication of the ""changing political scenario."" The by-election in Bhandara-Gondia is due as its sitting BJP MP, Nana Patole, resigned from the seat late last year and joined the Congress. The bypoll in Palghar is necessitated due to the death of its sitting BJP MP Chintaman Wanga in January this year. Also, following the death of senior Congress leader Patangrao Kadam, there is a vacancy in his Palus-Kadegaon Assembly seat in Sangli district. The dates of these bypolls are yet to be announced. Last month, the Congress thumped the ruling BJP in Rajasthan, clinching the two Lok Sabha and one state Assembly seats in the bypolls. It also retained two Assembly seats in by-elections in Madhya Pradesh, though with reduced victory margins. However, state BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said the reasons for defeat in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh were different. In MP, the Assembly seats were retained by the Congress though with reduced winning margins, Bhandari said. In Rajasthan, the Congress wrested two Lok Sabha seats from the BJP, while in Uttar Pradesh, the party suffered a jolt, he admitted. ""The Uttar Pradesh chief minister (Yogi Adityanath) noted that the loss was due to overconfidence and complacency,"" he said. There is anti-incumbency against Patole, who had won on the BJP ticket in 2014 but later quit and joined the Congress, Bhandari said. Similarly, in Palghar, late Chintaman Wanga's popularity and goodwill will stand the BJP in good stead at the hustings, he claimed. Wanga was a long-time MP, he said, adding that the party's organisational base in Palghar is strong. ""We also won the Palghar zilla parishad and the panchayat samiti elections,"" he pointed out. The BJP leader also said that the lack of clarity on an alliance between the Congress and the NCP was another positive for his party. However, Sawant said the Congress will take along all ""like-minded"" parties and discussions were on in this direction. ""The deliberations will be expedited once the by-elections in Maharashtra are announced,"" he said. NCP spokesman Nawab Malik claimed there was tremendous unrest in rural Maharashtra over the sloppy implementation of the loan waiver scheme, and due to the violence in Pune's Bhima-Koregaon area. ""This unrest will be reflected in the by-elections, when they are held,"" he said. Malik alleged that the BJP may try to delay the announcement of dates of the bypolls in Maharashtra. To a question on lack of clarity on the tie-up between the Congress and the NCP for by-elections in Maharashtra, Malik pointed out that the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party also stitched up the alliance at the last moment, just before the bypolls in UP.

74,The Quint,Not Even 2 Lakh Jobs Have Been Created by Modi Govt: Manmohan Singh,"Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday, 18 March, launched a scathing attack on the NDA government, accusing it of having ""messed up"" the economy and mismanaging the dispute in Jammu and Kashmir. Speaking at the 84th plenary session of the Congress in New Delhi, Singh described the government's demonetisation move as ""ill-considered"" and the GST as ""hastily implemented.â€ Singh also dismissed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's comment about farmers' incomes being doubled. On the issue of security, he said: Singh also called out the BJP government on its promise to create jobs. He further condemned the government for mismanaging the Kashmir issue.

75,The Quint,BJP Put Up  Murder Accused as Their Party President: Rahul Gandhi - The Quint,"The 84th Plenary of the Congress party in New Delhi concluded with party president Rahul Gandhi making a blistering attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah. He said, â€œThey (people) will accept a man accused of murder as the President of the BJP, but they will never ever accept the same in the Congress Party because they hold Congress in the highest regard.â€ Hitting back at the Congress chief over his attack on Amit Shah, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that it was astonishing that the Congress president chooses to make allegations against the BJP chief even though he has been cleared by a court. ""Gandhi himself is out on bail in Herald case, whereas our party President Amit Shahji, has been cleared by court,"" she said. Gandhi also laid out the roadmap for the Congress party ahead of 2019 elections and said there will be major restructuring in the internal functioning of the party. He admitted that the last Congress government was not able to meet the expectations of the people. He said, â€œI don't say it with happiness, but the last government we formed did not stand up to the expectations of the people. The people of the country were let down by us.â€ Stressing the need for discipline, and said, â€œLet us put all differences aside and work together to ensure victory for the party.â€ The Congress leader added that the corrupt and powerful today ""control conversation"" in the country and said, â€œThey tell Muslims of India who never went to Pakistan and supported this great nation, â€˜You donâ€™t belong hereâ€™. They tell the Tamils, â€˜Change your beautiful languageâ€™, they tell people of North-East, â€˜We donâ€™t like what you eatâ€™, they tell women, â€˜Dress properly or weâ€™ll thrash youâ€™.â€ In a direct hit at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Gandhi said Modi was not fighting corruption, but was ""corruption himself"" and under him, the country is controlled by ""corrupt and powerful"". Referring to the former Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Lalit Modi and diamond jeweller Nirav Modi, who are accused in different cases of fraud, he said that ""Modi gives Modi Rs 30,000 crores of your money and in turn, Modi gives Modi money for marketing Modi and fighting elections"". In response, Sitharaman termed Gandhiâ€™s attempt to link the Prime Minister with the fugitives ""a fake narrative"". Responding to the above comment, BJP leader and Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, â€œRahul Gandhi's rant was shameful. The way he spoke of the judiciary was irresponsible.â€ Recalling the two warring sides of the epic Mahabharat, Gandhi said the BJP, like the Kauravas, fought for power, while his party, on the lines of the Pandavas, battled for truth. Taking another jibe at the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS), the Congress President said, ""(Mahatma) Gandhi spent 15 years in jail and died for the nation. But India must never forget that while our leader slept on the floor in jail, (Vinayak Damodar) Savarkar wrote a letter to the British begging for mercy and clemency.â€ Terming Gandhiâ€™s speech the â€œrhetoric of a loserâ€ and â€œdevoid of substanceâ€, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the party which questioned the ""fundamental existence"" of Lord Ram today wants to be identified itself with the Pandavas. Javadekar also reacted to his remarks and said, ""He has insulted Hindu religion and people's faith. He has also insulted patriotism by criticing Vir Savarkar and also attacking judiciary. Nobody has accused PM personally but he has attempted to do so."" Taking the ruling BJP head-on, Gandhi said the party sought to divert people's attention from issues such as unemployment and farm distress with ""fancy events"". â€œInstead of acknowledging the challenges facing the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi diverts our attention from our problems. We are being told that our problems only exist in our imagination,â€ he said. Union HRD Minister and senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar responded saying he should apologise for his party's misdeeds first and then attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""While accusing the Modi government, he forgets that Congress did worst of genocide of Sikhs, they brought censorship in media and are known for all kinds of corruption and scams. He should first apologise for all that,"" Javadekar said. Holding that his party spoke on behalf of the country, Gandhi said, ""The BJP is the voice of an organisation, and the Congress is the voice of a nation.â€ Gandhi voiced the hope that India would, in the next decade, play an all-important role on the global stage. ""There are two visions in the world â€“ of US and China. In 10 years, I want to see India's vision there,"" he said. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

76,Shadab Moizee,Has Tejashwi Yadav Become Biharâ€™s Lalu 2.0? - The Quint," Purnendu Pritam It is said that politics is no childâ€™s play. But a youngster is preparing for 2019 elections in Biharâ€™s politics. He is 29-year-old, Lalu Prasad Yadavâ€™s son, Tejashwi Yadav, who gave up on his cricket career to join politics. Despite the fact that his win in Araria did not attract as much attention as Yogiâ€™s defeat in Gorakhpur, Tejashwiâ€™s victory has challenged the two main political leaders. The question that arises is whether Tejashwi Yadav has become Biharâ€™s Lalu 2.0. His victory means a lot, but one must understand how he got here. Tejashwi, who started his career in cricket, has inherited politics. He was elected as an MLA from Raghopur in Vaishali districts for the first time in 2015. He defeated BJPâ€™s Satish Kumar, the man who defeated his mother, Rabri Devi in 2010. The young Yadav has taken his revenge. RJD won the 2015 elections with the most votes. Because of Laluâ€™s situation then, and Tejashwiâ€™s talent, he became Biharâ€™s deputy CM. Tejashwi has always been active on social media. And because of him, Lalu Yadav too became active on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Tejashwi understood the need of the hour and the importance of social media, pushing RJD to become active on twitter and Facebook too. But within 20 months of him being sworn in as deputy chief minister, he was accused of corruption, and chief minister Nitish Kumar broke the mahagathbandhan to join hands with the BJP. It was a big blow to Biharâ€™s politics. But It could have been a blessing in disguise for Tejashwi Yadav, because it was in the meantime that he became proficient in political tactics. Soon he come to be known as the leader in power, instead of just as Laluâ€™s son. Lalu was jailed for the fodder scam and there were questions of how a fresher like Tejashwi could hope to compete with established powers like Nitish Kumar and the BJP. But Tejashwi proved them wrong. Tejashwi proved himself. Tejashwiâ€™s first move to was to break the alliance between Jitan Ram Manjhi, Hindustani Awam Morchaâ€™s chief and Nitish Kumarâ€™s old friend, and the NDA. Manjhi is known to be a Dalit leader. Tejashwiâ€™s second move was to poach JDU's MLA Sarfaraz Alam, who was made to contest the Araria bypoll, where Alam outright defeated BJPâ€™s candidate. But the young Yadav did face setbacks. He claimed he'd win a majority in the Legislative Assembly after the grand alliance broke, but he couldnâ€™t manage. Though he did set his image by winning the bypolls. Now, on one hand, he has to handle the party. On the other, he needs to keep his image clean. He has the big 2019 elections to worry about. His real test has only begun.

78,PTI,"Cong Agri Resolution Promises Loan-Waiver, Increase in MSP - The Quint","The Congress on Saturday, 17 March, said that if voted to power, it would come out with a loan-waiver scheme for small and marginal farmers similar to that announced by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in 2009. Adopting a resolution on â€œAgriculture, Employment and Poverty Alleviationâ€ at the party's 84th plenary session, it hit out at the Modi government for its â€œflawedâ€ and â€œanti-farmerâ€ policies that have caused an ""agrarian crisis"" in the country. The party claimed the scheme of the UPA government in 2009 had benefited 3.2 crore farmers. The crop insurance scheme of the Modi government benefited private insurance companies more than the farmer, it said, alleging that the money was taken away from farmers' bank accounts without their consent. The Congress said if the party formed the government after the general elections next year, it would set up a permanent commission for farm labour welfare with a constitutional status to guarantee social security at old age. The party said it would also provide interest-free loans to cover input costs to tenant farmers, sharecroppers and farmers owning and cultivating up to two hectares of land as was done by the Congress governments in Haryana and Rajasthan in the past. It resolved to bring in a farmer-centric paradigm shift in the agriculture sector and restore profitability. On the poverty alleviation front, the party said it will create a national poverty alleviation fund and impose a five percent cess on incomes of the top one percent people. â€œThe Congress shall ensure that Aadhaar is not used to deny benefits to the poorâ€, the resolution said, adding that it should be used to improve targeting the eligible beneficiaries under the National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) and other welfare schemes. The party also said if voted to power, it would re-examine the issue of GST on agricultural equipment to lower input costs for farmers. The wealth of the top one percent has gone up by 73 percent while that of the bottom half of the population has grown by just one percent during the BJP rule, it claimed.

82,Mayank Mishra,"Gorakhpur, Phulpur & Araria Result: Writing is on the Wall for BJP - The Quint","Sandeep Suman and Vishal Kumar Gorakhpur, Araria and Phulpur â€“ three Lok Sabha seats and three losses for the Bhartiya Janta Party. What does this mean for the saffron party? The BJP has not lost a single Lok Sabha election in Gorakhpur since 1991. Yogi Adityanathâ€™s former Lok Sabha seat is also home to the Gorakhnath Mutt, where the CM was once a Mahant. The temple wields considerable influence on this area and has played a major role in the previous elections â€“ making this bypoll loss a heavy one for the BJP. The first conclusion that can be drawn from this result is that people are no longer buying the Hindutva narrative. In fact, they appear to be irritated by this narrative. Over the last year, the Hindutva agenda has been pushed to such an extent that the probability of course correction has diminished. So we may draw the conclusion that the anger and discontent among the people will only increase. Araria has been a laboratory of BJPâ€™s secondary strategy â€“ counter-polarisation. Muslims make up 40 percent of the regions population, and along with the Yadav community, they account for over half the population in the area â€“ leading one to assume that the RJD would be the favourite to win this seat. The BJP attempted to consolidate the non-Muslim voters in their favour by peddling the narrative that non-Muslims need to come together to counter the Muslim community â€“ a strategy that has brought them success in Rampur, Saharanpur and Muradabad. While this failed, the loss of Araria also proves that even the so-called â€˜invincibleâ€™ Modi-Nitish combine was unable to keep the BJP afloat in Bihar. Just take a moment to comprehend this, BJP suffered a loss of 13 percent of their votes in Phulpur in 2018. If this is an indication of changing trends, then the BJP is in for a spate of bad luck in North India. These polls hold three major messages for the BJP. First, that Hindutva has become stale for the voters. Second, that the voters have begun to see through the strategy of counter polarisation. And third, that the BJP is losing the advantage of â€˜Modi waveâ€™ and that even old allies like Nitish Kumar canâ€™t help the saffron party retain its sheen â€“ at least in some areas.

84,Reuters,Xiâ€™s Trusted â€˜Firefighterâ€™ Lieutenant Becomes Chinaâ€™s Vice-Prez - The Quint,"Chinaâ€™s largely rubber-stamp parliament chose former top graft-buster Wang Qishan, a key ally of President Xi Jinping, as vice-president on Saturday, 17 March, a widely expected move that nonetheless breaks with convention and underlines Xiâ€™s dominant authority. Xi was also re-elected president by the parliament, with no votes cast against him. The body is packed with party loyalists and there was no chance he would not win the vote. Wang bowed twice and then walked over to Xi to shake his hand after the vote was announced inside Beijingâ€™s Great Hall of the People. Only one person voted against Wang out of the 2,970 votes cast. Xi and Wang spoke only to pledge allegiance to the constitution, with Wang giving the podium an emphatic tap after he finished. He was a major player in Xiâ€™s battle against corruption, with dozens of senior officials jailed during his tenure as the top graft-fighter, including the fearsome domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang, now serving life in jail. Zhao Wanping, a delegate from the central province of Anhui, told Reuters Wangâ€™s election was in line with the will of the people, pointing to his anti-corruption efforts. Last Sunday, parliament voted to amend the constitution, which removed presidential and vice-presidential term limits, meaning Xi can stay in power indefinitely, a move the government has presented as widely welcomed despite criticism that has evaded the censors and seeped onto Chinese social media. Wangâ€™s appointment has the potential to reshape what has traditionally been a ceremonial role. Chinaâ€™s relationship with the United States is likely to be a key part of his remit, according to diplomats and sources with ties to the leadership. Cabestan said Wang would likely be considerably more influential than his immediate predecessor, Li Yuanchao, given his close relationship with Xi and greater international profile. But any effort by China to elevate formal exchanges with the United States on tricky trade issues, for example from a cabinet to vice-presidential level, would require the White Houseâ€™s consent too. Wang also speaks no English. US President Donald Trump is seeking to impose tariffs on up to $60 billion of Chinese imports and will target the technology and telecommunications sectors, two people who had discussed the issue with the Trump administration said this week. Whether Xi could retain Wang in a senior role despite his reaching retirement age had been seen as a key measure of Xiâ€™s power and the subject of much speculation in the lead-up to this monthâ€™s National Peopleâ€™s Congress. Despite holding no official senior party role, Wang has taken center stage at plenary sessions this parliament, seated immediately next to the seven members of the Standing Committee, in a clear indication of his actual status. At the opening session where Premier Li Keqiang presented the governmentâ€™s work report, Wang cut a relaxed figure, staring straight ahead impassively while other delegates busily read and jotted down notes. Protocol at major political events, including seating arrangements and the order in which leaders are shown in state news bulletins, are tightly choreographed to convey a political message. Wang cast his ballot on Saturday immediately after Han Zheng, the seventh-ranked and most junior Standing Committee member, drawing enthusiastic applause from the other delegates Wang has otherwise kept a relatively low profile at parliament so far, with no state media reports of any visits to other provincial delegations to rally legislators, as members of the Standing Committee have done, including Xi. Cao Huiquan, a Hunan delegate who heads the provinceâ€™s Economic and Information Technology Commission, told Reuters last week that Wang had taken part in the Hunan delegationâ€™s discussions of Liâ€™s work report. On Saturday, parliament also formally approved a government restructuring plan that merges Chinaâ€™s banking and insurance regulators, gives new powers to policymaking bodies such as the central bank and creates new ministries.

Even more than the Narendra Modi government's failures on the employment and agricultural fronts, it is the party's and the government's haughtiness, reflected in the vice president M Venkaiah Naidu's characterisation of Modi as â€œGod's gift to the nationâ€, which has been undermining the party's standing. The party also neatly divided the people into ""Ramzade"" (children of the Hindu god, Ram) and ""haramzade"" or illegitimate children, as Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, so eloquently put it. Any opponent of the party was promptly placed in the anti-national or anti-Hindu category and told to go to Pakistan if he favoured the consumption of beef. Tourism Minister KJ Alphons advised visitors from abroad to eat all their beef before coming to India. The reaction against the BJP's hate was slow to take shape presumably because the people, especially youngsters, retained their faith in the Prime Minister's â€œSabka saath, sabka vikasâ€ (or development for all) promise. It still works in states like Tripura, which has seen little economic growth under prolonged communist rule. Now, the Uttar Pradesh by-polls have provided resounding confirmation of the slide in the party's fortunes in mainland India. For Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to lose in his redoubt of Gorakhpur, where he is the head priest of the Gorakhnath temple, is far more indicative of the way the cookie is crumbling than the fall of the former chief minister Manik Sarkar's government in Tripura, which was a cause of elation in saffron ranks. Adityanath's ascent was meant to be a kick in the teeth for the ""secular"" camp, which could not believe that a Hindutva hawk would be made the Chief Minister of India's largest state. The other reason why the BJP would be stupefied is that it will now have to shelve its decision to field Adityanath as the third main campaigner for the party after Modi and party president Amit Shah. Till now, the Chief Minister had been deputed to election-bound states to boast about the ""developments"" that were taking place in Uttar Pradesh. Now, he will be an ""unstarred"" campaigner, as a Congress minister in Karnataka has mockingly said. It is not unlikely that Adityanath will be derided on the next occasion when he addresses an election rally. His admission that over-confidence led to the BJP's defeats in Gorakhpur and Phulpur is only partially correct, for it was not so much self-assurance which undercut the party but supercilious pride of being saviours of the nation from its ""enemies"". The three or four ""captive"" television channels of the BJP have also been ringing alarm bells about the caste-based combination of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), as well as the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), bringing down the ""nationalist"" BJP in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Even then, it is clear that the successes of these parties have sent out the message to the Congress and other opposition parties that the ground is ripe for unseating the BJP by a united front. Till now, the BJP's only hope of staying afloat was the disarray in opposition ranks. It may have also placed considerable faith in the machinations of cynical old-timers like Mulayam Singh Yadav to create fissures in the non-BJP ranks of the kind which enabled it to win big in Uttar Pradesh last year. But the times are changing. Young leaders like Akhilesh Yadav have shown that it is possible to overcome the earlier two-decade-old enmity between the SP and the BSP to bring the BJP to heel. The RJD has also demonstrated that its M-Y (Muslim-Yadav) base of support has remained intact despite laloo Prasad Yadav's incarceration. Besides, the Bihar outcome has shown that the latter's son, Tajeshwi, has found his political feet. There are now several relatively young leaders like Rahul Gandhi, Akhilesh Yadav, Tajeshwi, Jignesh Mewani who are in the field. As Rahul Gandhi's recent meeting with Sharad Pawar showed, they are now taking the initiative along with elders like Sonia Gandhi to bring the opposition parties together on a common platform. If they succeed, the BJP's chances of repeating 2014 in the next general election are dim.

86,The Quint,"Pune Transwoman Denied Entry Into Mall, to Take Legal Action - The Quint","A transwoman was allegedly stopped from entering a shopping mall in Pune on Friday, 16 March. Sonali Dalvi went to Phoenix Market City with her friend, Manoj Boilkar. In a two-and-a-half minute video that Boilkar recorded â€“ which has gone viral on social media â€“ Dalvi can be seen waiting at the mallâ€™s gate after she was stopped by security. She demands to see any official document that prohibits her entering the mall. According to , when the duo reached gate number 5 of the mall for security check, Boilkar went to the menâ€™s security check and Dalvi went to the female section. While Boilkar was allowed to pass, the female security guard allegedly refused to frisk Dalvi and asked her to step out. The mall authorities then allegedly told Dalvi that she would not be allowed to enter the mall as she was a transgender person. Dalvi said that she demanded a statement of the mall policy stating that she would not be allowed to enter being a transwoman, but the officials could not provide any. She has decided to take legal action against the mall, the report added. â€œWe tried asking them what the problem was, and when they claimed that she will not be allowed since she is a transgender, I decided to shoot the entire thing on my mobile phoneâ€, Boilkar, who shot the entire episode on phone, told  . According to  , the mall came out with a statement and had a different story to tell. While Dalvi claims that she was made to wait for over an hour, the mall authorities say that she was allowed entry in less than five minutes. The statement by Phoenix Market City, published by  reads: â€œWe would like to state that on the basis of the detailed report from the security agency, the person in question was asked for verification by the security guards and directed to the desired destination in less than five minutes. We regret any inconvenience caused to the customer but security precautions are part of the process. We would also like to clearly state that we neither had nor have any intentions of hurting sentiments or discriminating against anyone on the basis of their caste or gender. In fact we strongly believe in an inclusive society. It is a public space and everyone is welcome.â€ Rajiv Malla, director of the mall said the mall authorities will sensitise the staff. â€œThis woman has visited the mall in past and there have been no such issues. We checked CCTV footage, we'll sensitise our staff for future. Everyone is welcome and allowed hereâ€, said Malla. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

Facebook said in a statement that it learned in 2015 that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, Aleksandr Kogan, ""lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, which does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc."" The company said Kogan billed his app on Facebook as ""a research app used by psychologists."" About 270,000 people downloaded the app, and in so doing, gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it. Facebook said Kogan gained access to the information ""in a legitimate way"" but ""he did not subsequently abide by our rules,"" saying that by on passing information to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Wylie of Eunoia ""he violated our platform policies.""

89,The Quint,Cong Political Resolution: â€˜No One Can Dictate What We Wear & Eatâ€™ - The Quint,"In its political resolution, moved at the 84th Congress Plenary session, on 17 March, the Rahul Gandhi-led party launched a scathing attack on the BJP-RSS. India's core constitutional values are under attack and freedom of all is in jeopardy, with institutions under stress and their independence compromised, the political resolution noted. The Congress resolved to bring together all like-minded parties and formulate a common and workable programme to defeat the BJP-RSS in the 2019 general election. This indication of a pre-poll tie-up comes in the wake of efforts by the party to evolve a consensus among various opposition parties to unitedly take on the BJP. Here are the key excerpts from the Congressâ€™ political resolution: The party hit out at the BJP-RSS ideology, alleging that it was creating an environment of â€œdistrust, fear and intimidationâ€ in pursuit of their â€œinsidious and divisive agendaâ€. The resolution reads: â€œThe prime minister and the BJP government are intolerant of any criticism and remain in arrogant denial. The RSS-BJP is misrepresenting, distorting and misusing religion to exploit the sentiments of the people and capture political powerâ€. The Congress condemned the BJP government for â€œbrazen abuse of power and misuse of central agencies for targeted political vendetta to harass, humiliate and persecute its political opponentsâ€. The Congressâ€™ political resolution said that under the BJP regime, the people of the country, be it farmers, labourers, unorganised sector workers, self-employed, Dalits, traders, minorities and the poor have been â€œbetrayedâ€. Calling the BJP â€œauthoritarian, divisive and disruptiveâ€, the Congressâ€™ political resolution said the BJP's move to hold simultaneous elections is â€œmisplacedâ€ and is â€œincompatible with the Constitution, as also impracticalâ€. The resolution also called for reverting to the old practice of paper ballot, as adopted by other major democracies, to help restore the credibility of the electoral process. This, the party said, was necessary as there were misgivings on the â€œmisuseâ€ of EVMs to â€œmanipulate the outcome contrary to popular verdictâ€. Facing the challenge of defections in the party, with the BJP poaching many of its leaders, the party sought debarring defectors from contesting elections for six years to check the â€œbrazen misuse of money power to create political instabilityâ€. On corruption, the party said that the BJP government â€œlacks sincerity in fighting corruption, to ensure transparency and accountabilityâ€. The nation today faces serious challenges to its security both internal and external. Terrorism, insurgency, attacks along the LOC and International border and Left-Wing extremism are grave threats to internal security, the resolution noted. The Congress said the judicial system needed urgent reforms for effective and timely dispensation of justice. The Congressâ€™ political resolution called upon the media to restore the balance in national narrative to safeguard democracy. The creation of Telangana and the successor state of Andhra Pradesh was enacted through the AP Reorganisation Act by the UPA government in 2014, only after consensus by all the major political parties present in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh. Dr. Manmohan Singh announced the award in Special Category Status of Andhra Pradesh among other things in Parliament on 20 February 2014. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

90,Rajesh Jain,UP-Bihar Bypolls: 3 Takeaways for the BJP and a WarningÂ  - The Quint,"In the previous   and video, we discussed the three winners â€“ Mayawati, the RJD and Caste, and three losers â€“ Nitish, the Congress and the BJP. In this column, we will discuss the three takeaways for the Bharatiya Janata Party â€“ it needs 50 percent vote-share, which will not come via division, and so it needs a switch to prosperity. There is also a warning being sent by voters is in the form of a reminder to PM Narendra Modi of a promise he had made in the 2014 campaign â€“ which he has forgotten, but the voters have not. During the 2014 elections, a few of us involved in the campaign would talk about the BJP needing to cross 40 percent vote-share in UP to win a large number of seats. It did just that. The game has now changed. The non-BJP parties face an existential challenge â€“ form an alliance or perish. This in turn means that the BJP now has to aim to win a majority of the votes cast â€“ 50 percent or higher. The BJP did this in exactly half (141) of the 282 seats it won in 2014. To win 50 percent or more, the BJP will not be able to play on divisions based on caste, community or class. The playbook of the past will not provide a guide to the future. It also will not be able to simply make promises. It will now be judged based on its performance both at the Centre and in the states it controls. While PM Modi is its vote-catcher, the novelty factor has worn off. Polarisation and splitting will not be as effective for BJP to cross the majority threshold in seats it hopes to win. What the BJP will need to do is to make a switch to prosperity not just in its messaging but also in its actions. Prosperity is the key to a happy and growing nation. Prosperity is not about a gas cylinder, an electricity connection, a bank account, an insurance scheme or a loan waiver. Prosperity can trump all electoral gimmicks of parties; it can beat Mandal and Mandir. Indiaâ€™s future elections will increasingly be fought on economic issues, with voters asking â€“ â€œWhatâ€™s in it for me?â€ Real and structural reforms in education, healthcare, labour, land, agriculture, bureaucracy, police, judiciary combined with privatisation, deregulation and devolution of powers to cities can truly transform India and make Indians prosperous. Modiâ€™s BJP still has the Lok Sabha majority to pull this off in the remainder of its term. Talk to people and ask them the one specific promise of Narendra Modi they remember from the 2014 campaign, and the inevitable answer is â€œ Rs 15 lakh to every poor familyâ€. This promise to them meant performance, prosperity,  ,  , end of corruption and a better tomorrow. No   or   talk can hide the lack of real delivery and performance on the ground. If there is one thing that Modi needs to focus on in his current term, it is this â€“ how can he fulfil the spirit of the Rs 15 lakh promise he made to Indians. By focusing on this and working like an entrepreneur heading a political startup, he can unleash an array of reforms that can crush Indiaâ€™s anti-prosperity machine. If he does not do it, we must unite and make it happen. It can be done, and starting next week, I will show you, Modi and every aspirant for the job of Indiaâ€™s First Prosperity Prime Minister how that Rs 15 lakh promise can be kept and how it can transform your life.

91,Vipin Pubby,Sorry Times for Kejriwal as Apology Causes Trust Breakdown in AAP - The Quint,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which has been hurtling from one crisis to another after its stunning victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, is now facing an existential crisis in Punjab. The apology tendered by the party supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia in a drug-related defamation case, has led to revolt by top state leaders of the party. The news came as such a stunning blow to them that most of them are now considering breaking away from the party. Punjabâ€™s drug menace was one of the foremost issues raised by the AAP during the run-up to the campaign for the Assembly elections in the state last year. In fact, the Congress and the AAP had been trying to outdo each other by raking up the issue at all election rallies. It was then that Majithia had emerged as the mascot of political support for drug trafficking in the state. The dragging of his name was particularly damaging to the Parkash Singh Badal government as, besides being a minister, he is also the brother of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal and brother-in-law of former Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. And now, the unqualified apology by Kejriwal has left the state unit of the party in a tizzy. The top state leaders, who were neither consulted nor informed about the move, donâ€™t know where to hide. This was an issue they had been taking up inside and outside the Assembly. They had also been highly critical of the Amarinder Singh government for not taking action against Majithia. Majithia was prompt in holding a press conference and displaying the copy of the letter through which Kejriwal had tendered the apology. He praised the Delhi CM for his â€œmagnanimity and statesmanshipâ€, while distributing copies of the written apology (submitted by Kejriwal in the courts), which stated that the allegations made by the the CM against Majithia were â€œunfoundedâ€. Senior AAP leader and Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, was the first to go public with a tweet that said he was â€œappalled and stunnedâ€ by the apology. Another prominent AAP leader and journalist Kanwar Sandhu tweeted that the apology was a â€œlet downâ€. AAPâ€™s state President Bhagwant Mann, who is also a Lok Sabha member, and the Co-President Aman Arora resigned from their posts. Even the Lok Insaf Party, which had an alliance with the AAP and had won two seats, broke off its ties with the latter. The party had won just four Lok Sabha seats from Punjab when the Modi-led BJP swept the 2014 elections in the country. The AAP had failed to win a seat even in Delhi, its stronghold. However, it took just about a year to witness the suspension of two of the four Punjab MPs. Professor Dharamvir Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa were suspended from the party for anti-party activities and continue to remain suspended. They didnâ€™t even campaign for party candidates during the 2017 Assembly elections. Shortly before the Assembly elections, the party removed its state President Sucha Singh Chhotepur on the allegations that he took money from a ticket aspirant. Subsequently, the party appointed its leaders from Delhi to finalise candidates. The choice of candidates led to much dismay and resentment among party cadres. Some of the candidates had a shady past or were not known in their areas. It was well known that the state unit leaders had not been sharing cordial relations with the central leaders and there was a general lack of communication. It is no surprise, therefore, that there was absolutely no communication or discussion on the apology tendered by Kejriwal. The mutual suspicion and mistrust seems to have reached its breaking point now. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political
92,IANS,Gorakhpur Made BJP Realise Even This Can Happen: Rajnath Singh - The Quint,"Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday, 17 March, said the loss in Uttar Pradesh bypolls made the the Bharatiya Janata Party realise that ""even this can happen"" but ""it will not happen again"". The minister's statement came days after the BJP suffered a double jolt as it was trounced in the Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha bypolls for the Gorakhpur and Phulpur and in Bihar's Araria. â€œIt happened, will not happen again. We realised even this can also happen,"" the minister said, addressing the CNN News18 Rising India Summit. Gorakhpur was held by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for five consecutive terms, while Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya was Phulpur's elected Lok Sabha representative. Commenting on Congress President Rahul Gandhi's statement that the country was rising against the BJP, Singh said: On being asked if he harboured the dream of being Prime Minister one day, he said he was not ""over ambitious"". Asked whether the interference by Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in the Ram Janmabhoomi issue was right, Rajnath Singh said: ""We cannot stop him from mediating in the issue. As far as the government is concerned, the matter is sub-judice"". Replying to a question if the Jawaharlal Nehru University was creating problem in the internal security, the Minister said he didn't think so, adding: (The Quint is now on WhatsApp. To receive handpicked stories on topics you care about, subscribe to our WhatsApp services.

93,Rajesh Jain,Winners & Losers of UP-Bihar Bypolls: Is Regime Change in the Air? - The Quint,"Indian politics is getting very exciting. The discontent of voters now seems to be turning into anger. If the recent election results are anything to go by, regime change seems to be in the air. The outcome of the bypolls in UP and Bihar have also captured the headlines. More importantly, there are three takeaways and a warning â€“ which we will cover in the next column and video. Without contesting either of the two UP seats in Phulpur or Gorakhpur, Mayawati is the biggest winner. By ensuring a transfer of her votes to SP, she has shown she holds the trump card in deciding who wins UP, and therefore India. Her asking price will see an extra zero now added to it. Without Lalu Prasad Yadav, it was expected that his party would fade away. This has not happened. It retained the Araria Lok Sabha seat in Bihar. The RJD is very much alive and kicking, and has the potential to hurt BJPâ€™s Bihar ambitions. Without the feel-good factor in terms of jobs and economic growth, it is caste that counts in the Hindi heartland. This is because people perhaps feel a sense of  setting in against the BJP, whom they trusted with a handsome mandate in 2014, and in the UP assembly elections of 2017. Because Nitishâ€™s JD(U) failed to transfer its votes to the BJP, there will surely be a rethink in the BJP about the alliance. Nitish has lost face with this defeat, and given an opening to a leaderless RJD. Because it really had no business contesting the UP bypolls, Congress too has suffered. It is better off pulling out from UP and Bihar to prevent a division of the anti-BJP votes, and focus on fighting the 150 Lok Sabha seats, where it is the principal opponent of the BJP. Since headline management and narrative control is so important for the BJP, it had no business losing the two important seats in UP. Politics is all about perception, and the aura of invincibility is slowly breaking in the land which delivered most of its seats. The warning is in the form of a reminder to Narendra Modi of a promise he had made in the 2014 campaign â€“ which he has forgotten, but voters have not.

The report attempts to provide a more comprehensive measure of economic progress than gross domestic product (GDP) alone by considering the combined wealth from four different sources: produced capital (plants and factories), human capital, financial capital and natural capital (resources such as forests, minerals, etc). Low-income countries, where natural capital constituted a major share of wealth, doubled their wealth between 1995 and 2014, the report shows. But on a per capita basis, their wealth grew by only 17 percent over this period due to high population growth. South Asia saw among the biggest gains in per capita wealth over the past two decades, the report shows. But countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw faster growth in per capita wealth compared with India because of gains in human capital formation.

97,PTI,Pak Failed to Take Stern Actions Against Terrorists: White House - The Quint,"Pakistan has failed to take decisive actions against terror groups as sought by the Trump administration, the White House said on Friday, 16 March, and warned Islamabad that the US is prepared to take actions on its own to safeguard its personnel in Afghanistan. US President Donald Trump had announced his South Asia Policy in August last year, criticising Pakistan for providing safe havens to terror groups carrying out attacks in Afghanistan. Expressing the White House's displeasure on the alleged continued reluctance on the part of Pakistan to take action against terrorists, the official said, ""We are still seeking actions from Pakistan that we have not seen. We are continuing to look for real actions and not word on the Taliban and the Haqqani sanctuaries."" Noting that the US wants to see actions against terrorist, the official said, the Trump administration was ""prepared to take steps which we feel are necessary to safeguard our personnel"" in Afghanistan. The official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, insisted that there is an urgency on the part of Pakistan to take action. Citing some of the recent high-profile attacks in Kabul by terrorists from across the border, the official said, ""It's Pakistan choice on which direction it wants to take the future of the relationship,â€ adding that the US was still engaging Pakistani leaders. â€œThe US is interested in addressing some of the Pakistani concerns, but the ball lies in Islamabad's court,â€ the official said. The Trump Administration, for the first time, has really restored clarity to the US-Pakistan relationship. ""We are truly holding Pakistan accountable for its actions,"" the official said, adding the president has made it clear that he is not satisfied with the action taken by Islamabad. ""We have communicated clear to Pakistan to what we mean by decisive action,"" the official said, without giving details about the kind of action the US wants to see from Islamabad except for saying that it wants complete elimination of terrorist safe havens from within its territory. ""When provided very specific information, they (Pakistanis) have responded. But we have not seen them taking pro-active actions against terrorist groups. (we believe that) They are very capable (in taking those steps),"" the official said. On questions about the deadline, the official said the US is in discussion with Pakistan. ""We do not talk in terms of deadlines.â€ However, Pakistan understands that the way the America appropriations are set up and there are deadlines with regard to assistance. These Congressional deadlines will sometime kick in, the official added. The US also wants Pakistan to take action against Pakistan-based terrorist groups that target India like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). ""We believe that the release of Hafeez Saeed in November was a step in the wrong direction,"" the officials said, ruing that Pakistan has not taken sufficient steps with regard to curbing finances of terrorism. The official also said Pakistan has been taking ""bare minimum"" actions against terrorists on the US' request. ""We expected that this would be difficult for Pakistan. We expected that it would take some time for Pakistan to break those relationship between intelligence services and the militants. So far, we have seen them taking bare minimum steps that we are requesting,â€ the official pointed out in response to another question. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

A case was registered and efforts were made to find the boy, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said. However, on 3 March, the body of a boy was seen floating in Agra Canal. The body was sent to AIIMS mortuary as it resembled the boy. The father subsequently identified him and the autopsy revealed that he had a sharp cut injury on his neck. A 10-year-old rape survivor was left unattended in her blood-soaked clothes and excruciating pain for around 11 hours at Gurugram Civil Lines Hospital, in another alleged case of medical negligence that came to light barely a month after a 25-year-old woman was forced to deliver a baby in the open in front of the emergency ward of the hospital. The doctors and paramedical staff attended to the minor girl and gave her clean clothes only following an intervention from the Child Welfare Committeeâ€™s chairperson next morning.

The incumbent Akali Dal and its ministers, hence, became Kejriwalâ€™s most obvious target. Punjab, in those days was known for its notorious drug mafia and Kejriwal saw it as a low-hanging, poll-time fruit. But Majithia filed a criminal defamation case against Kejriwal and other senior AAP leaders for bringing great disrepute to his public standing. It wasnâ€™t long before the ghosts of his 2016 speech came to haunt him back. On 15 March 2018, Kejriwal wrote an apology letter to Majithia, saying that the charges he had made in poll-bound Punjab were â€œunfounded.â€ But the Delhi Chief Ministerâ€™s apology drew widespread criticism, not only from within the AAP but also from Punjabâ€™s political circles. The partyâ€™s top leader and lawmaker Bhagwant Mann, who had campaigned extensively against Punjabâ€™s drug menace, resigned from the post of stateâ€™s party president. So did his partyâ€™s Punjab Vice President Aman Arora. Lashing out at Kejriwal for â€˜betrayingâ€™ the people of Punjab, senior Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu said â€œthe people of Punjab had seen the AAP supremo as an alternative leader. But with this U-turn, Kejriwal has back-stabbed them all.â€ In his letter, Kejriwal said allegations against Majithia are 'unfounded.' But how did he find it out? On 16 February this year, the Punjab govt told the Punjab High Court that the state policeâ€™s report on Majithia's alleged role in the drug trade, was still being examined. In fact Kejriwal, had made â€˜trial by publicâ€™ and â€˜trial by mediaâ€™ his signature style, while taking on his opponents. Whether it was PM Modi, or the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, the MCD, or the Delhi Police chief. He was the fearless  he thrived on defamation case, it was his badge of honour. This abject surrender, this â€˜sorryâ€™, it changes everything. He is no longer an Aam aadmi. He is just another convenient politician. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

103,Prachi Salve Alison Saldanha,Tribal Farmer Rights Statistics in Maha Paint a Worrying Picture - The Quint,"With a wooden staff in her right hand and a communist flag in the left, a diminutive, 85-year-old woman stood tall in the Azad Maidan sports ground. Kamli Babu, an   (tribal) farmer who works as a farm hand for part of the year, had walked 180 km, covering 30 km each day under the harsh early summer sun, to be a part of the Kisan Long March. A peaceful protest march organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (All Indian Farmers Association), affiliated with the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPM), the march began on 5 March at CBS Chowk in central Nashik with some 15,000 farmers. Over the course of the week to 12 March, their numbers more than tripled as more farmers and agricultural labourers joined in along the route. Their destination: Mumbai. Their aim: to get the attention of the state government. Their demand: a fairer deal for the struggling farm sector. Faced with a public relations disaster, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis met with a delegation of the protesting farmers on 12 March. Immediately thereafter, he  that all the farmersâ€™ major demands had been accepted and would be fulfilled in six months. The government would expand the eligibility criteria for its farm-loan waiver scheme introduced in 2017 to ensure all deserving farmers get relief, the chief minister said. And a committee would be formed to advise on the best way to ensure minimum support prices (MSP) for farm produce, an issue already touched upon in the union budget for 2018-19. â€œThe government now has six monthsâ€™ time. If they do not meet the demands of the farmers, the next stage of this protest will not stay confined to farmers alone. It will be a mass movement,â€   Sitaram Yechury, CPM general secretary. The stateâ€™s past record is anything but inspiring. Maharashtra features among the top four states with forest areas over which traditional dwellers such as tribal cultivators can be given land rights. (The others are Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.) However, it rejects nearly two-thirds of all claims of community or individual tribal ownership of forest land, shows an IndiaSpend analysis of Tribal Ministry  . Most states do not explain why claims are rejected. Those that do, often cite as the most common reason the lack of documents to prove the claimant has been cultivating the land in question. In fact, the Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006, under which claims are processed, makes it clear that documents should not be insisted upon. Across India, scheduled tribes are Indiaâ€™s poorest people, with five of 10 falling in the lowest wealth bracket, IndiaSpend   on 28 February, 2018. About 93 percent live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture, mostly of the subsistence variety. Their literacy rates (59 percent) are significantly lower than that of the general population (74 percent), and in 86.5 percent of tribal homes, the monthly salary of the highest-earning member is less than Rs 5,000 ($76), IndiaSpend   on 2 July, 2016. Tribal communities practicing settled agriculture suffer from various problems, which government reports such as   one have acknowledged: unproductive and uneconomical holdings, land alienation, indebtedness, lack of irrigation facilities, lack of power, absence of adequate roads and transport, lack of access to bank credit facilities, seasonal migration to other places for wage earning, and lack of extension services and education hindering their ability to modernise. It can secure the rights of over 200 million tribal people belonging to more than 170,000 tribal villages, according to this 2016   by Oxfam-India and the Rights and Resources Initiative, an international non-governmental organisation. However, in the 12 years since the enactment of the FRA, only 3 percent of the minimum potential of community forest rights have been achieved, the report says. It estimates the minimum potential at 85.6 million acres, excluding Jammu & Kashmir and Indiaâ€™s northeastern region. This denial reverberated across Azad Maidan. â€œFor years we have been working on the land but we still have no claim to it,â€ said Kamli Babu, who has tilled a three-acre patch for as long as she recalls. â€œAt any time they can evict us from our home saying this is forest land. We have no security. Weâ€™re constantly fighting encroachment.â€ â€œIn Surgana district, the forest department has reclaimed the land on which people have been working for several years now, by planting trees in the field. We do not want the same to happen to us,â€ said Nana Chahale, a 34-year-old Adivasi farmer from Nashik district, whose family has been working a piece of land since the 1970s. â€œWe have been protesting for land rights since 2010,â€ he added. Without ownership, tribal farmers such as Prabhakar Kadhale, 35, are prevented from making investments that will raise their output from the land they till. â€œIf we have ownership, we can dig wells, introduce irrigation for year-round crops and will be finally eligible to apply for loans with government banks instead of cooperatives,â€ said Kadhale, from Dindori taluka in Nashik district, adding, â€œWithout recognition our lands remain without electricity, irrigation, roads, and we cannot cultivate for more than one crop season a year. For the other six months, we have to work on other farms to support ourselves.â€ In June 2017, also in response to farmersâ€™ protests across the state, the Fadnavis government had announced a loan waiver scheme that would cost the state exchequer Rs 34,000 crore ($5.2 billion). Since 2017, nine other states â€“ Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telanganaâ€“have witnessed similar farmer agitations demanding loan waivers. Meanwhile, the chief minister also assured farmers of a better policy for minimum support prices (MSP). Earlier, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had announced in   that new MSPs would guarantee 50 percent returns over and above the farmersâ€™ cost of production. Neither of them has clarified the definition of â€˜cost of productionâ€™. The protesting farmers have demanded that the Maharashtra government fix MSPs as per the recommendations of the 2006 M.S. Swaminathan committee report. The report had suggested that cost of production be calculated by including â€œvisible componentsâ€ such as seeds, fertilizers, hired labour and irrigation costs as well as, crucially, â€œinvisible costsâ€ such as family labour, interest on fixed capital and rental value of owned land. However, whether this formula will be used has been doubtful because the central government had told the Supreme Court in February 2015 that it could not deliver on this formula, as     on 1 April, 2015. Chief minister Fadnavis also did not address the issue of low agricultural wages. Nationally, agricultural workers constitute 90 percent of the informal rural workforce. Households that own less than one acre of land, such as Kamli Babuâ€™s, earned an average income nearly 30 percent lower, Rs 4,561 ($70). Of this, 64 percent, or Rs 2,902 ($45), was earned from labour wages. â€œFor the cropping season after the monsoons, my son and I work on other peoplesâ€™ farm for our livelihoods. I am paid for my work with food, not money,â€ Babu told IndiaSpend. Payments in kind are so common across India that even the NSSO calculates its average wages for labourers based on the local market retail prices of food commodities, â€œwhich include cooked food, tea, food grains, etc.â€ Meanwhile, small and marginal farmersâ€™ income from cultivating the land they occupy is 0.6 percent of their average monthly income, NSSO data show. â€œI want the government to give me some pension so I can at least retire soon,â€ the octogenarian Babu said, adding that she had submitted her application to the local   in 2015 but had not heard back. For the welfare of small and marginal farmers and labourers, who are estimated to constitute 90 percent of the rural informal sector, the government has instituted five pension schemes under the National Social Assistance Programme: Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme, Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme, Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension Scheme, National Family Benefit Scheme and Annapurna. Housing and non-agricultural employment are also provided under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)-Rural and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Further, the number of beneficiaries registered for the NSAP programme has fallen by 10 percent between 2014-15 and 2017-18. This is despite Aadhaar enrollment across India reaching nearly 90 percent. The main reason for this decline in registration is lack of verification of applicantsâ€™ identity, a 2015   by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said. A Below Poverty Line (BPL) status is the most-widely used eligibility criteria. However, being poor does not automatically get one a BPL card, and having a BPL card does not ensure a pension, a 2014   in eight states by the Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) and Pension Parishad found. For example, in Gujarat only 30 percent of those eligible were receiving a pension, the study said. At Rs 55,000 crore ($8.4 billion), allocations for MGNREGA remain unchanged from 2017-18 to 2018-19. However, in the five years to 2016-17, the proportion of households receiving employment under the programme has dropped seven percentage points from 97 percent to 90 percent, IndiaSpend   on 29 January, 2018. Further, 56 percent workers reported wage payment delays while 15 percent job-seekers did not find any work in 2016-17, our analysis showed. â€œWe try to break the cycle of poverty but weâ€™re constantly pulled back,â€ Hari Kale, a 38-year-old farmer from Nashik district, said, back at Azad Maidan. â€œOur children only study up to standard VIII, until education is free,â€ said Gunvant Parshuram Tone, a 56-year-old farmer from Amravati district. â€œWe donâ€™t have money for college fees, notebooks and textbooks. The children say itâ€™s better to work and earn an income than study.â€ Speaking of her grandchildren, Kamli Babu smiles. â€œWhen we go to work in the field, we send the little ones to the local A  [government day care centre], where they get  for lunch,â€ she said, â€œI hope they can look at a better future before I go.

104,The Quint,â€˜Murder of AAP in Punjabâ€™: Kejriwal Apology to Majithia Draws Flak - The Quint,"Punjab Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday, 16 March, said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal had ""murdered"" his party in the state by apologising to Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikram Singh Majithia. The Delhi chief minister had, on 15 March, apologised to Majithia for accusing him of being involved in the drug trade in Punjab, saying he had learnt that his allegations were â€œunfoundedâ€. Hitting out at Kejriwal, Sidhu added, ""Man like coward Kejriwal dies everyday for fifty times. But a brave man dies only once in life. This is a psychological death of the party. Kejriwal has decimated the AAP in Punjabâ€. ""Initially, he tried to run the party (in Punjab) from Delhi through remote control. Today, he is a helpless gambler"", he alleged. Kejriwal's apology drew flak from his party's leaders and MLAs in Punjab, who said they were ""stunned"" by the move and ""disappointed"" as he had not kept them in the loop. Soon after Kejriwalâ€™s apology, Sukhpal Singh Khaira, AAP leader and the Leader of Opposition in the Punjab Assembly, tweeted that the Delhi chief minister did not consult other party members. Another AAP leader from Punjab condemned Kejriwalâ€™s apology. Kumar Vishwas took a jibe at Kejriwal, and accused him of not standing by his words. SAD leader and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal lashed out at Kejriwal on Friday, accusing him of cheap politics. Former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister and SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal said he is happy that those fighting for truth have won. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

105,The Quint,BJPâ€™s Lok Sabha Tally Will Reduce by 110 Seats in 2019: Shiv Sena,"Terming the BJP's loss in the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha bypoll a ""defeat of ego and arrogance"", the Shiv Sena launched a fresh salvo at its ally on 16 March saying the party's strength in the Lower House of the Parliament will come down by at least 110 seats in the 2019 general elections. The Sena also taunted its ally saying those who abandon their friends and ""tread the path of lies"" are destined to lose. It said that since the Modi government came to power, bypolls to 10 Lok Sabha seats were conducted, of which the BJP lost nine. The editorial referred to the BJP's stunning victory in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls in 2017 as it attacked the party over its loss in the Gorakhpur bypoll. â€œLast year, the BJP set a record by winning 325 seats in UP Assembly polls. Yogi Adityanath became the chief minister, while Keshav Maurya became his deputy. Since 1991, Adityanath had never lost the Gorakhpur seat. But now, despite being the CM, his party lost. If the BJP could topple the Left government in Tripura, why couldn't it win Gorakhpur?â€ it asked. In Bihar, the Araria Lok Sabha seat and the Jehanabad Assembly seat were won by the RJD, it said. ""All this shows that the BJP is losing ground,"" it said. â€œIt is now clear that in 2019, the BJP will not get 280 seats. The number will come down by at least 100-110. Therefore, the BJP needs to remain grounded. Defeat is certain for those who abandon their friends and tread the path of lies. When the downfall starts, no Chanakya can stop it,â€ it said. The party said that after the bypolls in Rajasthan, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had said that the Congress should only contest bypolls now. ""The BJP's loss in the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha bypoll is a defeat of ego and arrogance,"" the Sena added. Meanwhile, in the backdrop of TDP and YSRCP moving no-confidence motions against the government, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis reportedly held a meeting with Shiv Sena's Anant Geete, who is also the Union Minister for Heavy Industries and Public Sector Enterprises, on Friday, 16 March. According to an NDTV  , the meeting, also attended by BJP Maharashtra president Raosaheb Danve - was called to ensure the Shiv Sena's support to the central government, in the event of the no-confidence motions getting admitted and a vote being carried out. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray was expected to hold a meeting with his party MPs and other senior leaders to decide its stand on the no-confidence motions, reported ANI. Notably, Shiv Sena had earlier declared that it will go out alone in both the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well as the assembly elections in Maharashtra and not in alliance with the BJP.

106,PTI,No Parallel Inquiry by Courts in PNB Fraud CaseÂ  - The Quint,"The Centre, on 16 March, told the Supreme Court that there cannot be a ""parallel inquiry"" and ""parallel monitoring"" by the court in investigations while opposing a suggestion given by the apex court to the CBI to file in a sealed cover the status of the probe in the over Rs 11,000 crore Punjab National Bank fraud case. A bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, was told by Attorney General KK Venugopal that even before the investigating agencies start probing the matter, people come to courts with public interest litigations. The attorney general (AG) also contended that why such petitions should be entertained by the courts unless there was something wrong shown by the petitioner. Terming this issue as serious, Venugopal told the bench that such a matter would bring down the morale of the investigating agencies. The AG opposed the plea filed by lawyer Vineet Dhanda, who has sought an an independent probe in the PNB case and also a direction to the government to get diamond merchant Nirav Modi deported. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has already registered two FIRs â€“ one on January 31 and another in February â€“ against billionaire Nirav Modi, his relative Mehul Choksi of Gitanjali Gems and others for allegedly defrauding the PNB of about Rs 11,400 crore. During the hearing, the bench took exception to the submissions advanced by the petitioner that the AG had not read the prayers sought by him in the plea. The court said that such statements were unacceptable and posted the matter for hearing on 9 April. The PIL has made PNB, the Reserve Bank of India and the ministries of finance and law and justice as parties. It has sought a direction for initiation of deportation proceedings against Nirav Modi and others allegedly involved in the banking fraud, preferably within two months. It has asked for a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the case, allegedly involving Nirav Modi and Choksi and also sought a probe into the role of the top management of PNB. The plea has sought a direction to the finance ministry to frame guidelines on the grant and disbursal of loans involving big amounts, besides ensuring safety and recovery of such loans. It has also sought the setting up of a body of experts to deal with cases of bad banking debts in the country. In his PIL, Dhanda has also sought a direction to fasten liabilities on the employees of a bank for sanctioning loans on the basis of deficient documents and said loans should also be recovered by attaching the properties of such bank officials even after their retirement.

107,Syed Ata Hasnain,Do Indian Civil Service Aspirants Need Compulsory Military Training for 5 Years?,"The Parliamentary Committee on Defence is reported to have recommended five years of compulsory military service for anyone who wants subsequent employment with the state or the central government. The committee apparently wants the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to prepare such a proposal and take this to the Centre. However, on the outset it is necessary to explain that executing such a desire is impractical given the sheer size of our recruitable male and female population (gender equation being a compulsion too). Examples of nations such as Israel, Singapore, Switzerland or the Nordic states, which follow such a system, cannot be taken as a model. Their population bases and nature of threats are altogether different. However, giving the Parliamentary Committee its due, there is nothing such as conscription in the recommendations set out. All that the committee has done is that it has sent a broad proposal concerning only aspirants for government service and that too for only gazetted ranks. Five years compulsory service in the armed forces will, as per its perception, achieve two things: Some more advantages can be perceived with a closer examination of the proposal. Among them is the likely progressive improvement in civil-military relations as more civil services officers having undergone military service reach higher ranks of bureaucracy or police services. This is an aspect of functioning in India which has drawn much negativity. In future years, the bond of the uniform, the respect for camaraderie built in the ranks, essentials of regimental bonding and much more will come forward to overcome traditional rivalry. No one is denying that rivalry may still exist but denting it will help the system. There can be no doubt about the fact that the proposal will need many summers before it can be approved, and refinement will include experimentation and lessons, besides a full look at terms of service for each type of personnel. The armed forces are always accused of having a pyramidal system for the officer cadre where wastage is extremely high. This is because the majority joins the â€˜main cadre,â€™ thus becoming aspirants for long service and higher rank. This makes competition intense. Existing alongside is a â€˜support cadreâ€™ â€“ those in service for a shorter duration and not aspiring for long service and higher selection rank. Ideally every service of the armed forces should have a large officer based â€˜support cadreâ€™ and a lean â€˜main cadreâ€™ so that the force remains young in profile with quicker promotions and less competition. In India, however, itâ€™s the other way around. Any reversal of this cannot happen in isolation. Those exiting also have to be taken care of, by side stepping them into other services that donâ€™t require stringent standards of physical fitness. In India, no other service accepts them despite a Cabinet-approved proposal of 2004, on what is called the â€˜peel factorâ€™ (employing those peeling off from the cadre at different stages). Stringent medical and physical fitness standards will need to be adopted and can be anticipated as one of the obstacles to the final clearance of this proposal. In addition, there can be consideration for ante date seniority for those who do military service and then join the civil services; that is if the civil services cadre could have acceptance with a dual intake pattern, combination of those who serve the armed forces and those who come in directly. All these details will obviously be examined with a fine tooth comb, and the DoPT is adept at evolving cadres with varying terms and conditions. What the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee do not deserve is outright rejection as some kind of a hare-brained idea. It needs to run the gamut of serious examination followed by short-term experimentation. If successful, it will have achieved much, but a conclusive decision appears to be a good distance away.           (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

108,PTI, SC Rejects  Bimal Gurungâ€™s Plea Seeking Protection From ArrestÂ  - The Quint,"The Supreme Court on Friday, 16 March, dismissed former Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) leader Bimal Gurung's plea seeking protection from arrest in several cases lodged against him in West Bengal and for an independent probe into the alleged killings of Gorkhaland supporters in the state. A bench comprising Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan rejected the GJM's plea saying it was not a fit case for relief. The apex court had on 20 November restrained the West Bengal police from taking any coercive steps against Gurung. The GJM leader had claimed in the top court that he was being politically persecuted by the Bengal government. However, the Mamata Banerjee government had submitted a list of 53 FIRs lodged against Gurung and said he was facing trial in another 24 cases as well. The GJM central committee had recently suspended Gurung for six months and appointed Binay Tamang as the party's new president.

110,Alt News,Audio Analysis of Araria Video With  Pro-Pak Slogans Raises Doubts - The Quint,"After BJPâ€™s loss in Araria, Bihar, in the bypoll elections, a video, allegedly from Araria and where it is being claimed that supporters of the winning candidate Sarfaraz Alam are raising pro-Pakistan slogans, went viral. The video can be seen below. Even a casual look a the video will make it apparent that there are serious issues with the lip sync in the video. Alt News decided to dig deeper into this and do an audio analysis of the above video. We examined this video from 3 independent sources. 1)   (Size: 478528 bytes) 2)   (Size: 1640713 bytes) 3) Video received via WhatsApp which can be downloaded  . (Size: 1553257 bytes) We analysed the three videos using an audio editing software called  . What is observed consistently across all the three videos is that in two spots in the video, the volume or the audio level is ZERO (circled). The above two spots with zero audio level are roughly between 1) 0.000 and 0.140 seconds 2) 18.500 and 19.400 seconds An expanded version of the waveform where audio levels are ZERO can be seen below. The same lack of volume can be seen when the audio is analysed using   which is an acoustic spectrum analyzer software. The image generated by Spek can be seen below. The two distinct spots with zero audio level is even more apparently in the waveform generated by Spek. If you listen to the video, youâ€™ll hear a sound of a vehicle in the background, one which resembles a tuktuk. There is also other kinds of commotion going on in the background that is audible. However, all that background noise becomes ZERO at the above mentioned time intervals which raises the initial suspicions about this video and its authenticity. As we mentioned earlier, the very first observation about the video was that it didnâ€™t seem to have lip sync. To ascertain whether the audio and video are in sync, we examined individual frames from the video against the audio waveform. For those who are interested in knowing how to break down a video into individual frames, we used   which is a cross-platform video editor. The following highlighted command will break down the video into individual frames at a rate of 30 frames per second and add a timestamp to the top left. The timestamp reflects the position of an individual frame with respect to the start of the video. A zip file with all the frames obtained using the above command can be downloaded  . From the above images, we created various collages to see the lip positions of the subjects in the video. The following collage has frames from 3.100 seconds to 3.767 seconds of the video. As can be seen in the above collage, only the person on the right has his mouth visibly open while the other two people have their mouth shut. The person on the right has his mouth visibly open from 3.200 seconds to 3.700 seconds. If the audio and video are in sync, the audio waveform should show increased audio levels during this period. Does it? The audio waveform shows almost nil audio levels in the duration 3.250 seconds to 3.500 seconds. This shows that while the subject on the right had his mouth open and is visibly exulting, the audio for the corresponding period doesnâ€™t match and shows close to nil audio levels. This shows that the audio and video are not in sync. The above observations necessitate that the video be examined by a certified forensic laboratory for its authenticity. With so many easy-to-use software tools available which allows one to dub an audio over an existing video, news channels or journalists shouldnâ€™t be propagating such videos without doing an independent analysis of their own. Videos like the one above can cause friction between communities of an area and can be used as part of a political agenda. It is therefore of utmost importance that when these videos become viral, extra care must be taken before mainstream media further popularises such videos. Two persons have been reportedly arrested with regards to the above video and we hope that police investigation will throw further light on the authenticity of the video. The audio analysis of the videos circulating on social media raise several red flags and hence a detailed forensic analysis of the video should be done. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

113,Sanjana Ray,Did All India Radio Censor BJPâ€™s Loss in UP-Bihar Bypolls? - The Quint,"Indiaâ€™s national public radio broadcaster, All India Radio (AIR), did not say a word about the BJPâ€™s crushing defeat in the UP-Bihar bypolls in its daily broadcast of the news on Thursday, 15 March, raising more than a few eyebrows. Considering that the radio network is known to cover major daily national and international news developments, it is extremely surprising that its news bulletin didnâ€™t have anything to say on the ruling partyâ€™s losses in the seats of Phulpur, Gorakhpur and Araria in its morning segment, though it did find time to report the Indian cricket teamâ€™s win over Bangladesh. The fact of BJPâ€™s significant losses in UP and Bihar did not make it to any other section of their website either. Sanjay Kumar, the Director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, put out a tweet on Thursday morning questioning the radio networkâ€™s silence on the bypoll results, where the BJP lost to the Samajwadi Party and RJD in the three Lok Sabha seats it contested. The morning news that was covered by the radio network on Thursday ranged from updates on the Nirav Modi scam to Indiaâ€™s GDP growth rate, but seemed to skip over the part where the ruling party, following its great recent victory in Tripura especially, was dealt a blow in these bypolls, one being in UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanathâ€™s home turf of Gorakhpur. Is it possible that the network, which in its   has been â€œserving to inform, educate and entertain the masses since its inceptionâ€, censored the BJPâ€™s loss in the UP-Bihar bypolls?

114,Vivek Katju,India Need Not Worry About Iranâ€™s Attempt to Soothe Pakistanâ€™s Ego - The Quint,"After Iranian President Hassan Rouhaniâ€™s successful visit to India in February 2018, his Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has sought to â€˜assuageâ€™ Pakistani concerns about his countryâ€™s cooperation with India, especially to develop the Chabahar port. He went on to say, â€œIt is not a project to encircle Pakistan or anybody, but to develop the region which requires a lot of development.â€ Moving away from Chabahar, Zarif assured Pakistan that Iran would not allow its territory to be used against Pakistan, â€œjust as Pakistan will never allow anyone to hurt Iran from its territoryâ€. Zarif is a veteran diplomat who negotiated the US-Iran nuclear deal with the then US Secretary of State John Kerry. He chooses his words with great care; hence, it is essential for India to assess his message to Pakistan. This is all the more important because the connectivity that India seeks through the Chabahar port to Afghanistan and beyond, is part of its long-term regional strategy. Zarif was not articulating a new Iranian position in seeking connections instead of competition between Gwadar and Chabahar. However, as Iran is going ahead with developing the port with India, the signal to Pakistan is that such connections will have to be with an India associated port. This is because Iran has agreed to give India operational control of a part of the port for a year-and-a-half. Complementarity implies co-ordinated, if not common, arrangements. Will Pakistan agree to the Iranian offer, especially as Gwadar is going to not remain merely a commercial port? For India, whose primary interest is in connectivity through Chabahar and thus, a presence there, the Iranian offer to Pakistan should, in any case, be no cause for alarm. Its focus should be on delivering on all its commitments on Chabahar, even though working on the ground in Iran is never easy. Zarifâ€™s reference to Saudi Arabia, while seeking to soothe Pakistanâ€™s worries about India-Iran ties, was deliberate and meaningful. It is no secret that Pakistanâ€™s relations with Saudi Arabia are far closer and more intense than with Iran. This is both on the sectarian and the security axis. However, Pakistan has occasionally tried to balance its ties with both countries. This was particularly so after Saudi Arabia and Iran locked horns in 2015 in the Yemen civil war. The Saudis wanted Pakistan to join the Sunni coalition which was directed against Iran. However, the Pakistani Parliament refused to allow it, and even more, the Army wanted to act cautiously. The Saudis were disappointed. Last month, Pakistan shed its earlier caution and agreed to augment its troop presence in Saudi Arabia â€“ under a defence agreement that a contingent of its troops is always stationed in Saudi Arabia. One reason for the changed Pakistani position is Indiaâ€™s growing ties with Saudi Arabia. Zarif criticised Saudi Arabia for not responding positively to Iranâ€™s desire to mend fences and for wanting to circumscribe its role and position in the region. Pakistan-Iran ties have to bear the full weight of Saudi-Pakistan relations, and this necessarily will constrain their growth. Zarifâ€™s not-so-subtle signal was to demand that Pakistan should maintain a balanced approach. In view of the tangled situation in West Asia, India does not face the real danger of Iran really diluting its relations with it to satisfy Pakistan. This was also demonstrated by differences in the Pakistani and Iranian accounts of the interaction of Zarif and his Pakistani counterpart Khawaja Asif on issues of concern to India. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry statement noted inter alia, â€œPakistan and Iran reiterated support for the peaceful struggle of the people of Palestine and Kashmir, and their right to self-determinationâ€¦â€. It is likely that Zarif and Asif have spoken about their perspective of the Kashmir situation, and once in a while, the Iranian Supreme Leader expressed a view on Kashmir which was not to Indiaâ€™s liking. However, what is noteworthy is that the Iranians are unwilling to take a joint position on Kashmir with Pakistan. Obviously, they do not want to annoy India on this subject and create an obstacle to growing bilateral cooperation. Clearly, at this stage, India does not need to be concerned about Zarifâ€™s remarks on Chabahar; it is Pakistan that should take his message on Saudi Arabia seriously â€” as in the past, Iran could potentially complicate its sectarian situation which is always tense.

115,Anmol Saini,"Dear Government, Passing Money Bills Without Discussion Isnâ€™t Cool - The Quint","Vivek Gupta If thereâ€™s one underpinning principle that guides parliaments across the world, it is informed debate and dissent within the confines of reason. It is here that matters of national and international consequences are deliberated and solutions to pressing issues are arrived at. But Indiaâ€™s ruling dispensation sought to turn this very principle on its head on 13 March 2018, when over 99 funding demands from government departments, 218 amendments, the Finance Bill 2018 and the Appropriation Bill were passed in a matter of 30 minutes without any debate in the Lok Sabha. The â€˜guillotineâ€™ however, can only be used on the last day of the period prescribed for discussions on the demands for grants. The process brings all outstanding funding demands to be put under vote for the explicit purpose of getting the passed at one go. Once the process is used, all pending demands must be voted on without any discussion. To be fair to Mahajan, the house witnessed repeated disruptions over the PNB scam, allotment of Special Category status to Andhra Pradesh. But approving decisions on where and how the government spends without discussion and especially through voice vote, doesnâ€™t bode well for a parliment. Among the demands passed were The Finance Bill, being a money bill can only originate in the Lok Sabha, following which, it is goes to the Rajya Sabha for approval. But the Rajya Sabha, also known as the upper house, has little power when it comes to suggesting amendments to a money bill, which may or may not be approved by the Lok Sabha. True that the opposition hasnâ€™t helped the situation any better. But passing bills with significant monetary impact without discussing them on the table is undemocratic.

116,Arun Dev,"Despite Gorakhpur Loss, Yogi to Continue Campaigning in Karnataka - The Quint","Who will be the chief guest for the valedictory function of the Karnataka BJPâ€™s Bengaluru Rakshisi Yatre (Save Bengaluru Rally), is a hot topic of discussion among the Bharatiya Janata Party leaders in Bengaluru. Yogi Adityanath or Amit Shah? The BJPâ€™s defeat in Yogiâ€™s home turf of Gorakhpur has raised the stakes on this simple decision. Although the initial choice for the job was Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the chatter among leaders hints at a possibility of Amit Shah replacing the former. The valedictory function, which was to be held on 15 March, now remains postponed until the decision is made. This has also raised doubts over Yogiâ€™s role as a star campaigner for the BJP in the state, and the impact he could make. Putting an end to speculations about the future of Yogi in the BJPâ€™s Karnataka campaign plans, the party announced that Yogi will continue his campaign in the state. A senior party leader said sticking to the original plan, Yogi will address seven to eight rallies in different parts of Karnataka. The leader insisted that the loss in the bypolls hasnâ€™t severely impacted the UP CMâ€™s popularity in the Karnataka, adding: However, a Congress leader pointed out that the BJP backing Yogi is not a surprise. In fact, it would have been a surprise if the party had decided to cut down on Yogiâ€™s campaign. â€œA decision from the BJP to reduce Yogiâ€™s presence in the Karnataka would show the party losing confidence. They wouldnâ€™t do such a thing. But this is immaterial, as we are certain that a person who couldnâ€™t even provide a win his own constituency, will not be taken seriously by the peopleâ€, said the leader, who is part of the Congressâ€™ campaign committee. For the BJP, removing Yogi from their campaign plans for Karnataka is impossible. As explained by a senior BJP leader, Yogi is part of the issue-wise division of the partyâ€™s campaign in Karnataka. The BJP, as part of its election campaign, has given clear roles to each leader. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be the face of the partyâ€™s promise of development, BS Yeddyurappa will project himself as a pro-farmer leader. Yogi and leaders like Anant Kumar Hegde form the third group, which will focus on the Hindutva ideology. The UP CM has been at the job effectively during this rallies in the state. During his first rally in Bengaluru, Yogi questioned Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for not banning cow slaughter despite being Hindu, in his second rally in Hubballi, Yogi raised the issue of the Karnataka government giving importance to Tipu Jayanti over Hanuman Jayanti, and during his third rally in Mangaluru, he raised the issue of deaths of Hindu  . â€œDespite the loss, Yogi is still in a strong advocate of the BJPâ€™s pro-Hindu policy. So, he is still relevant and effectiveâ€, added the BJP leader. The Congress in Karnataka spared no time in attacking Yogi over his partyâ€™s defeat in Uttar Pradesh. CM Siddaramaiah tweeted asking the UP CM not to lecture his state on development after the BJP lost the twin Lok Sabha by-elections in Uttar Pradesh. The Congress also targeted BJPâ€™s chief ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa, asking him not to bow before a man who canâ€™t even save his own former seat. For the Congress party, which had seen a lull in its election campaign, the BJPâ€™s loss in the Uttar Pradesh bypolls comes as a morale boost. The party believes the recent results havenâ€™t just impacted Yogiâ€™s image, but have also sent a strong message to the people about the slowing down of the Modi wave in the country. So, has the BJP actually lost its star campaigner in Karnataka? The answer to this question depends upon the partyâ€™s subsequent choice of chief guest at its Bengaluru rally. If chosen, it would be interesting to see what sort of a response Yogi gets from the crowd. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

117,Bilal Zaidi,"UP, Bihar Bypoll Results Analysis: Impact of Muslim Sentiments on By-Elections ","The results of Uttar Pradesh bypolls have surprised many political pundits. In less than one year, there has been a massive turnaround in the caste and demographic equations. Initial reports suggest that Mayawatiâ€™s Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has successfully managed to transfer their vote to the Samajwadi Party. The Muslim vote in both the constituencies â€“ Gorakhpur and Phulpur â€“ consolidated behind the Samajwadi Party. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had swept the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and done an encore in 2017 during the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, leaving the Opposition destroyed and left without any ideas. So what really happened in Gorakhpur and Phulpur in just about one year? On 9 March last year,  published a   conducted by Crowdnewsing, a civic-tech startup, in Uttar Pradesh on the stateâ€™s Muslim community. The one major finding of the survey was that there was utter confusion in the community on which party to vote for. Fifty-five percent of the respondents voted for the SP-Congress alliance and 36 percent said they voted for the BSP. This lead to a complete split in the Muslim vote, and as a result, the BJP sailed through even in seats which had traditionally alluded the saffron party. But more significantly, the survey, that was conducted in 10 districts of Uttar Pradesh covering all seven phases, also threw up a wishlist of the Muslim community. â€œThese tall leaders should drop their personal egos and come together in the interest of those who are being oppressed,â€ said Azeem, one of the respondents in Azamgarh. Among the issues that mattered the most before the elections last year, development of infrastructure, roads, water and electricity topped the agenda at 44 percent. Surprisingly, only 23 percent of the respondents voted to â€˜prevent riots and communal violence.â€™ Even job creation was the top priority for Muslims of Uttar Pradesh at 19 percent. On ground, these factors seems to have changed. Yogi Adityanath governmentâ€™s decision to regulate meat shops across the state, frequent cases of fake encounters, organised mob attacks and the rhetoric around contentious issues like Ayodhya dispute and Triple Talaq seem to have polarised the Muslim community even further. Perhaps in anticipation of the current state of affairs, the desperate cry for unity of Opposition saw a reflection in the survey that was subsequently carried by a number of leading national publications. The findings were significant. When we spoke to some of the election managers handling the SP-Congress alliance last year, we were told that efforts were made to reach out to the BSP ahead of the Assembly polls, but Mayawati decided to go alone. Even an unofficial seat coordination would have helped. Sources inside the BSP camp suggested that Mayawati was rather confident of a good showing in the 2017 polls. But with BJP sweeping away the elections, the Opposition was left with no choice but to find a way to consolidate the non-BJP voter. Mayawatiâ€™s BSP won zero seats in 2014 and fared poorly in 2017, so it comes as no surprise that she chose to support the SP. Even during the Babri Masjid mobilisation in the early 1990s, the SP and BSP had come together under the leadership of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Kanshi Ram. But the two parties eventually parted ways in 1995, following the humiliation of Mayawati and BSP workers at the hands of the SP cadre, in an incident thatâ€™s infamously called the â€œGuest House  â€ Ever since the split, the rivalry between the SP and BSP was seen more as a clash of egos between Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav. Add to that the bitter reality of caste-based violence against the Dalit community, where the oppressors were invariably from other backward groups which enjoyed political patronage of the Samajwadi Party during its rule. So how do you explain the transferring of votes from the BSP to the SP? This could be attributed to two things: Interestingly, the Nishad community is part of the most backward caste group and has been a critical voting segment in Gorakhpur with over 3 lakh members. According to  , Pravin Nishadâ€™s campaign described the Nishad, Dalit and Muslim combination as the solidarity of the 85 percent. The last few months have seen a spike in cases of atrocities against Dalits, with chilling videos doing the rounds on WhatsApp, including the incident in Unnao where a Dalit woman was  . Experts have been pointing towards drastically changing ground realities in Uttar Pradesh over the last one year. â€œEver since Yogi Adityanath has come to power in the state, there is a meteoric rise in attacks against the Dalit community. And this time, instead of other backward groups, the attacks are being committed by the upper caste. Not only have the number of cases almost doubled, but the impunity with which some members of the Rajput community are committing these atrocities and capturing it on camera, it has shocked the Dalit community,"" said Arun Khote, who runs Dalit Media Watch, a Lucknow-based organisation that monitors caste-based violence. Hence, Mayawati ending up going with the SP was only a reflection of what her own support base wanted. Perfect example of democracy working bottoms-up. Even though the Opposition is failing to throw up personalities that can take on the larger-than-life stature of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a new emerging trend can be seen. From the bypolls in Rajasthan to now in Uttar Pradesh, from student elections to local body polls, the BJP is struggling to deal with questions of joblessness, rural distress, widespread corruption in the banking sector, demonetisation, Aadhaar and implementation of the GST. The message from the electorate is clear â€“ the top down approach of personalities must make way for a bottoms-up approach where the issues are at the centre of the public discourse. And with PM Modi being unable to leash violent elements within his party, the desperation of Dalits and Muslims will only add to his woes. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

118,Amitabh Tiwari,"UP, Bihar By-Election Results Analysis: How Akhilesh & Tejashwi Turned the Tables for BJP in UP, Bihar","Two young turks Akhilesh Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav handed over big blows to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the recently concluded bypolls in the Hindi heartland. Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are key to the BJPâ€™s bid to retain power in 2019 as the party won one-third of its total tally from these two states in 2014. The two leaders entered into strategic alliances, campaigned aggressively and reached out to voters beyond their traditional support base to cause this upset halting BJP juggernaut. To dislodge SP from power, it was important for the BJP to negate the caste based voting pattern which UP was famous for. It entered into alliances with smaller parties like Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party of Rajbhar community and Apna Dal, which represents the Kurmis. The fact that it didnâ€™t declare a Chief Ministerial candidate helped. On the other hand, BSP gave a call to Dalits and Muslims thereby following an exclusionary strategy which alienated other sections of voters. Akhilesh was popular among all sections of society particularly the youth. However, his tie up with the Congress, was seen by its non-core voters as an attempt to unify the MY vote block, thus signalling a wrong message. The result of BJPâ€™s innovative experiment was that it received support from all sections of the Hindus, more than 60 percent votes of upper caste and non Yadav OBCs (core voters) as well as one-third votes of Dalits and one-fourth of Yadavs (non-core voters). This propelled BJP to its best ever performance in UP breaking its Ram Mandir movement record bagging 40 percent vote share (29 percent core and 11 percent non-core). However, after coming to power, BJP rewarded its traditional core voters with ministerial positions and somewhat sidelined its non-core supporters. To manage inner party dynamics, and also accommodate a key Modi-Shah aide at the top, the party ended up giving 2 out of 3 top slots to upper caste (CM + Deputy CM). Akhilesh was quick to pick up that this exclusionary tactics of BJP would cause heartburn among OBCs and Dalits. He decided to directly take on the BJP in Phulpur, fielding a candidate from the same community of Patels. BSPâ€™s decision not to field a candidate meant the significant Pasi votes could go to BJP like in 2017. This in the end proved to be the master stroke. The campaign focused on failures of the Modi government especially on the job front as the constituency has some 60 percent youth voters. In Gorakhpur, seat which BJP and allies held since 1989, SP went in for a strategic alliance with NISHAD party, representing the communities with traditional occupations centred on rivers. When the decision was made, BJP ridiculed the move, stating SP doesnâ€™t even have a candidate for the seat. Here again, the Dalit vote was very important (22 percent of population). With its broad understanding with BSP, Akhilesh managed to create a broad coalition of Dalits, OBCs, Yadavs and Muslims, calling out BJP as a â€˜manuvadiâ€™ party. In Araria, RJD candidate received 43 percent vote share and had won in 2014 primarily because BJP (27 percent) and JDU (23 percent) contested separately. With JDU on its side, BJP was confident of snatching the seat which it won in 2004 and 2009 despite Araria having a sizeable Muslim population of 43 percent. Tejashwi stood up to the challenge. He had to ensure JDU votes didnâ€™t transfer to BJP. He first tapped disgruntled Manjhi and got him to his side to make a dent into the Mahadalit votebank of Nitish. This way he ensured one-third of JDU votes, mostly minorities and Mahadalits, shifted to RJD. While RJD recorded 49 percent vote share, NDA could garner only 42 percent. In Jehanabad too, through the strategy of consolidation of Muslim votes and weaning away section of Mahadalit/OBC votes, RJD was able to retain the seat with 5 percent more vote share. Tejashwi also displayed the maturity of his father Lalu, handling the tricky seat sharing talks with Congress and ensuring anti-BJP votes are not divided. To conclude, the two young men have provided a template for the opposition to take on the BJP displaying immense maturity, adopting some of its best practices in social engineering and at the same time plugging loopholes in its â€˜Sabka Saath Sabka Vikasâ€™ model. The replication of this model on an all India basis will require a lot of hard work from various regional parties and Congress, some give and take, to survive the BJP onslaught.

The Samajwadi Party won in UP CM Yogi Adityanathâ€™s five-time constituency, Gorakhpur, by a landslide 21,961 vote lead. The Samajwadi Party also won the Lok Sabha seat in the Phulpur constituency, the seat which was vacated by Keshav Prasad Maurya when he became the Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017. The Samajwadi Party chief and former UP Chief Minister also added that had electronic voting machines (EVMs) worked without a glitch, the victory margins of his party's candidates in the Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha by-elections would have been higher. The ballot paper system was the best way of voting, the SP leader said, adding that it helped the people air their anger. Yadav, who congratulated the two victorious candidates in the Uttar Pradesh by-elections, said the party had complained about the EVMS and ""the Election Commission should take note of it"". ""The entire anger of the voters could not come out through the EVMs. Had ballot papers been used, the impact of the anger would have been clear,"" he stressed.

120,Arati R Jerath,SP-BSP Alliance a Sign That 2019 Will be a â€˜BJP vs the Restâ€™ War - The Quint,"At the end of the first week of the resumed Budget session of Parliament, the BJP looks dangerously poised to head back to those days of â€œmajestic isolationâ€™â€™ after the demolition of the Babri Masjid when no political party was willing to ally with it. MPs of all political hues shouted slogans, waved placards, didnâ€™t allow ministers to speak and created so much pandemonium that the Speaker was forced to adjourn the House every day without doing a stitch of work. TDP MPs were protesting against the Modi government for not giving Andhra Pradesh special status. Shiv Sena MPs were demanding the inclusion of Marathi in the classical languages category. The Opposition was on the issue of Nirav Modiâ€™s â€˜great escapeâ€™, pressing for an adjournment motion and debate. Senior MPs cannot remember the last time a ruling party came under this kind of sustained high-pitched attack, not just from the Opposition but from its own partners in government. By the end of the week, the BJP had lost a major partner from the government. The TDP withdrew its Union ministers but in a face-saver for the BJP, it has refrained from severing ties with the NDA for the moment. However, its MPs acknowledge that it may have to quit the NDA before the 2019 general election because it cannot contest in alliance with the BJP unless the Modi government makes some concession on the demand for special status for Andhra Pradesh and releases funds. The demand is such a volatile issue in Andhra that even the TDPâ€™s rival, YSR Congress, which has been flirting with the BJP in recent weeks, will hesitate to enter into an alliance with the BJP. This virtually shuts the door for the BJP in an important south Indian state that sends 25 MPs to the Lok Sabha. In neighbouring Telengana, which has 17 MPs in the Lok Sabha, the BJP stands similarly isolated. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, who was till recently quite soft on the Modi government, has developed a newfound enthusiasm for Mamata Banerjeeâ€™s proposal for a non-BJP, non-Congress federal front. The recent Assembly elections in the Northeast have certainly reinforced the aura of invincibility that the Modi-Shah duo has crafted around itself. In Tripura, the BJP soared from 0 to 43 and stormed the last bastion of the Left. In Nagaland and Meghalaya, it has formed governments in alliance with regional parties. As a result, it is in power in seven of the eight states in the Northeast which has been forbidden territory for the BJP for the last seven decades. Yet, reality may be a little different from perception. There is no doubt that the BJP has captured new territory and expanded its footprint across the country since the Modi government swept to power in 2014. But in virtually all these areas, it fought as an Opposition party against a tired ruling party, usually the Congress. This was a huge advantage for a party with fire in its belly and hungry for wins. Last weekâ€™s pandemonium in Parliament should serve as a wake-up call for the BJP. Majestic isolation was never a winning strategy for the party. In 1998 and in 1999, it had to create alliances to form a government at the Centre. It lost in 2004 primarily because most of its partners walked out of the NDA, leaving the BJP to fight the polls on its own. Significantly, like it will have to do in 2019, the 2004 elections were about defending territory, not trying to capture new ones as an Opposition force. As it plans for the 2019 general election, the BJP can hardly afford to be pushed back into majestic isolation again. Its prospects were boosted in the Northeast because it showed the flexibility to make new friends and partners even if meant compromising with its cow politics in Christian-dominated states like Meghalaya and Nagaland. Can it show the same flexibility in the heartland which it swept in 2014? Most BJP MPs admit that their numbers will come down in states like UP, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar where it performed phenomenally well in the last Lok Sabha polls. The BJPâ€™s ability to win elections is both its strength and weakness. Its recent victories in the Northeast may have gained it new governments but they have scared Opposition parties and allies alike. No party wants to go back to the days of one-party dominance when the Congress lorded it over the entire country. The coming together of once bitter rivals SP and BSP for two upcoming Lok Sabha by-elections in UP is evidence of the fear factor sweeping the non-BJP parties. Unless the BJP can keep the other side divided with smart tactics and â€˜lollipopsâ€™, it looks like the country is heading into a â€˜BJP versus the Restâ€™ line-up in 2019. Thatâ€™s the message from the pandemonium in Parliament this past week. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political
121,PTI,TMCâ€™s Decision to Celebrate Ram Navami Our Moral Victory: RSSÂ  - The Quint,"The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), on Wednesday, 14 March, said the Trinamool Congress' decision to observe Ram Navami in West Bengal is a moral victory for the organisation, as the ruling party had opposed the celebrations last year. The TMC had, earlier this month, said it has decided to observe Ram Navami in West Bengalâ€™s Birbhum district with a massive procession to be held on 25 March. ""It is a moral victory for the RSS that the ruling party is also saying that they want to celebrate Ram Navami. We welcome this decision"", RSS south Bengal General Secretary Jishnu Basu said. On the state government's directive against armed processions during Ram Navami, he said the RSS is against any armed procession, be it for Ram Navami or Muharram. The state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership, however see the TMC's decision as an attempt to hijack the programme from the saffron party.

122,Sanjay Pugalia,Breaking Views: Was Yogi Blindsided By Gorakhpur Voters? - The Quint,"What is the mood of the voter in India? Iâ€™ve been asking many people this question. If you consider Gujarat Assembly elections, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan bypolls to deliver one kind of message, Tripura delivered quite a different message. Maybe Karnataka will send a different message altogether. But question is, is the voter happy with the government, displeased with it or angry at it? The answer could be seen in the results of Gorakhpur, Phulpur, Araria and Jehanabad bypolls. It can be seen as a survey of the mood of the people. The answer is that public displeasure is slowly mounting to anger. It has sent a strong message to the governments in Delhi and Lucknow. The message is â€˜You are not running a government, but a mere election campaign. You are imposing an agenda on us which we donâ€™t buy. You had made some promises to us in 2014, itâ€™s time to fulfill them. Itâ€™s time to come out of the echo-chamber of campaign and propaganda.â€™ They have breached the bastion of Gorakhpur, where the current chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath was a Member of Parliament for the last 20 years. The city that is said to be in the grip of Yogi Adityanath. The BJP-Nitish alliance was dealt with a similar blow in Bihar. If they thought that the battlefield was clear after Lalu Yadav was jailed, his son Tejashwi emerged a formidable opponent. The myth that Mayawati would succumb to CBI pressure has also been dispelled in this election, when the BSP supremo decided not to field a candidate to ensure that anti-BJP votes arenâ€™t split. Just one year ago, the candidates from Samajwadi Party were badly defeated in the Assembly constituencies that fall under Gorakhpur and Phulpur. What changed in that one year that the public who had outright rejected Akhilesh in 2017 had now awarded him Lok Sabha seats that were once held by top BJP leaders? It can only mean that the next election is an open game and that there is no guarantee that BJP will achieve a majority in 2019 on its own. The summary of all the elections post 2014 is that the voter wants to return to the era of coalition politics. BJPâ€™s pet narrative of Hindu vs Muslim and India vs Pakistan may not work anymore. But it would be wrong to anticipate that the BJP will budge from this path. They did have the intention to increase their support base by focussing on the poor, the underprivileged, rural voters, Dalits, farmers and youth. For that, they have to take a stand which is anti-rich, anti-corrupt and may lead them away from the middle class. But this may simply result in the BJP losing on both fronts. The BJP may decide to sideline the questions that are being raised about its delivery on campaign promises. But what the BJP is claiming and what the voter feels in real life are two very different things. A proxy approach wonâ€™t work here. Mere stats on employment creation and development will not help the BJP and that, is the message. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

123,David Devadas,"J&K Is a Losing Battle for BJP, Stoking â€˜Communal Fireâ€™ Wonâ€™t Help - The Quint","BJPâ€™s Jammu and Kashmir unitâ€™s President Sat Sharma faced such tough questioning from a young television journalist on the morning of the BJP rally, ie, on Sunday, that he walked away mid-question (the BJP rules in coalition with the largely Valley-based Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party). That news clip lowered the general impression of the party â€“ which was already under question. This was ironic, for the BJP had organised this rally in the heart of Jammu, to try and showcase â€˜achievementsâ€™ over the first three years of the state governmentâ€™s six-year term.       Insiders say that even party bosses, and their patrons in the RSS, have realised that the BJP has lost immense ground in the Jammu province. In fact, one interpretation of some of the polemical issues that have been recently raised is that they are meant to stave off a reshuffle of ministers and office-bearers. If that is indeed the case, the activists who have proved inadequate as leaders, might only be making things worse for the party, even if some of them win a brief reprieve. One major issue of contention has been the police investigation into the armyâ€™s firing, in which three persons were killed in Shopian, in January 2018. The Supreme Court recently stayed the police investigation. The BJP wants the FIR quashed, and the PDP would lose face in the Valley if it backtracks. Meanwhile, the BJP faces a revolt within its ranks in Nowshera, right by the Line of Control. A major agitation in Nowshera has focused, over the past few weeks, on the electoral promise to turn the area into a separate district. The rape and murder of an eight-year old girl in Kathua last month has become a far more explosive issue. The local police botched up the investigation into the horrific crime from the start, even â€˜destroyingâ€™ crucial evidence. There are strong suspicions of collusion and a cover-up. The local Hindu Ekta Manch has agitated in support of the men arrested in connection with the crime. Two prominent BJP ministers have participated in this agitation. This issue has not only strained the coalition, it has also assumed a dangerously communal colour. Narratives about the crime have gotten mixed up with fear-filled talk about a demographic shift in the area. The girl, who hailed from the Bakerwal community, belonged to one of the very few Muslim hamlets in Kathua district. Many narratives about the rape refer to fears about a recent increase in Muslim settlements in the predominantly Hindu-inhabited area. If the BJP thinks this sort of communal issue will help it regain lost ground in the Hindu-dominated stretch from Jammu to Kathua, it is playing with a very dangerous fire. That stretch runs close to the border with Pakistan, and Samba and Jammu have both been targets of major militant attacks. This sort of communal (demographic) twist to such an abominable crime is unlikely to help the BJP regain lost political ground. Over the past year, people have become acutely aware of poor (or no) performance, huge corruption, callous unresponsiveness, and foolishness, on its part. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra asked Jay Shah and others, who have filed the complaint against the scribes, to respond within two weeks to the plea filed by the journalists against the Gujarat High Court's order, refusing to quash summons issued against them by the trial court. The bench, also comprising Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, observed that the media should be more responsible and said it cannot write whatever it feels about anyone. The CJI, while repeatedly stressing that he was not commenting on the case before it, also said that sometimes journalists write in a way that amounts to ""sheer contempt of court.â€ ""How can anyone write whatever they feel about anyone. There are limits,"" the chief justice observed. ""... they are writing sometimes which amounts to sheer contempt of court."" The Gujarat High Court had on 8 January rejected a petition filed by the news portal, seeking quashing of a criminal defamation case filed against it by Jay Shah over an article related to his company. The High Court rejected the petition on the grounds that the article â€“   is per say ""defamatory"" and the trial court should proceed with the case. After the suit was filed on 9 October 2017, the court initiated proceedings against them under CrPC's Section 202 (to inquire into a case to decide whether or not there is sufficient ground for proceeding). The suit has been filed against the author of the article, Rohini Singh, founding editors of the news portal Siddharth Varadarajan, Siddharth Bhatia and MK Venu, managing editor Monobina Gupta, public editor Pamela Philipose and the Foundation for Independent Journalism that is the publisher of The Wire. Jay Shah has separately filed a civil defamation suit of Rs 100 crore against the website over the article.

Burundi came bottom in the   which ranked 156 countries according to things such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, social freedom, generosity and absence of corruption. ""I've joked with the other Americans that we are living the American dream here in Finland,"" said Brianna Owens, who moved from the United States and is now a teacher in Espoo, Finland's second biggest city with a population of around 280,000. ""I think everything in this society is set up for people to be successful, starting with university and transportation that works really well,"" Owens told Reuters. The United States came in at 18th, down from 14th place last year. Britain was 19th and the United Arab Emirates 20th. Asked how the current political situation in the United States could affect future happiness reports, Sachs said: ""Time will tell, but I would say that in general that when confidence in government is low, when perceptions of corruption are high, inequality is high and health conditions are worsening ... that is not conducive to good feelings."" Finland took top honours in that category too, giving the country a statistical double-gold status. The foreign-born were least happy in Syria, which has been mired in civil war for seven years.

129,IANS,"Indian Economy Will Revive, to Grow at 7.3% in FY19: World Bank - The Quint","India would grow at 7.3 percent in 2018-19, the World Bank said on Wednesday, 15 March forecasting that the economy would revert to its trend growth rate of 7.5 percent by 2019-20 as it bottoms out from the impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and demonetisation. In the current year, the economy is expected to clock a growth rate of 6.7 percent, said the World Bank's India Development Update report, which takes stock of the Indian economy. ""While services will continue to remain the main driver of economic growth, industrial activity is poised to grow, with manufacturing expected to accelerate following the implementation of the GST, and agriculture will likely grow at its long-term average growth rate,"" it said. It added that reaching growth rates exceeding 8 per cent will require continued reform aimed at resolving issues related to credit and investment, and enhancing the competitiveness of India's exporting sector. According to the World Bank, India's growth in recent years has been supported by ""prudent macroeconomic policy"" including a new inflation targeting framework, energy subsidy reforms, fiscal consolidation, higher quality of public expenditure and a stable balance of payment situation. World Bank's India Country Director Junaid Ahmad said India's long-term growth has become more steady, stable, diversified and resilient. Poonam Gupta, the lead economist and the main author of the report, said that durable revival in private investments and exports would be crucial for India achieving a sustained high growth of 8 percent and above. ""This will require continued impetus for structural reforms. Resorting to countercyclical policies will not help spur sustained growth and India should not compromise its hard-earned fiscal discipline in order to accelerate growth,"" she added.

130,Ashutosh,BJP & RSS Must Learn That Thereâ€™s No Room for Hate in a Democracy - The Quint,"When I saw the morning newspaper, I felt terrible. A statue of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin in Tripura had been razed down by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers using a JCB machine. Not just that, those responsible for the act proceeded to play â€˜footballâ€™ with Leninâ€™s head. After Karl Marx, the second most influential figure of the last century was Lenin. Communist revolutions in other parts of the world were inspired by him. India too has a fair share of his supporters. Irrespective of how many factions the communists might be divided into, none of them has ever discredited Lenin. Even today, long after the fall of Communism, people still respect Lenin. The use of weapons to bring about social change was something I did not agree with. I viewed Mahatma Gandhi as my hero. Despite all his flaws, I liked the philosophy of  . His emphasis on spirituality over religion attracted me. But despite all this, I have always believed Lenin to be one of the three most influential leaders of the last century. I am also aware of the fact that after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the dissolution of communist governments in countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania, there too Leninâ€™s statues were subjected to similar indignities. It is also true that when American forces toppled the Saddam Hussein government in Iraq, his statue was also similarly razed and kicked around like a football. The American media widely broadcast that image, and it was used to prove just how fed up the people were with Saddamâ€™s dictatorship, and how the American forces had â€˜freedâ€™ the Iraqi people. Similarly, the one picture I recall most vividly from when the Taliban occupied Afghanistan is of the giant Buddha statues in Bamiyan valley being blown up with dynamite. The monumental, 4th and 5th century statues, were blown up simply because according to the then Taliban chief, Mullah Omar, they were against Islamic tradition. The entire world was shocked at the destruction of these historical artefacts and beautiful examples of â€˜Gandharaâ€™ art. Saddam Hussein was a dictator; he had oppressed his people. Blowing up the statues was a symbol of hate. A large section in the Middle East saw the treatment towards Saddam Hussein as an assault on Arab nationalism, Arab nationality and Arab identity. The BJP and the RSS have always shared a bitter relationship with communism. In his book, RSS leader Golwalkar includes communism as one of the enemies of the country. According to him, communism is a foreign ideology. Its commitment is to Soviet Russia and China, and   to India. He saw it as a power that would destabilise India on the directions of Russia and China. This is why, ever since thr BJP/RSS have come to power at the Centre, they have been likening communism with the act of treason. Similarly, students and officials with communist affiliations in Delhiâ€™s Ramjas College were also attacked by members of RSSâ€™ student wing. For many days, a kind of terror was unleashed. Here too, no action was taken against the perpetrators. While it is entirely possible that some people may be unhappy with communism in Tripura after 25 years, what was the fault of JNU and Ramjas College in the earlier instances of violence? The BJP shouldnâ€™t forget that it is the people who have given them an opportunity, but even in this election, the Left got the same 43 percent votes as them. They also shouldnâ€™t forget that India cannot be compared to either Saddam Husseinâ€™s dictatorship, Bamiyan, or even the former communist states. India is a democracy. Regime changes in India do not happen over the barrel of a gun nor is there a tradition of forcefully toppling governments. Do RSS/BJP want their prominent leaders to be meted out a similar treatment as Lenin in states like Orissa, Bengal, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, Kerala, Mizoram, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi where the BJP isnâ€™t in power? The BJP/RSS should also not forget that during the Vajpayee government, a picture of RSS/BJP ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar adorned a wall in Parliament despite widespread protests. In 2004, BJP lost power. But the picture remained. This, despite Savarkarâ€™s name being associated with the assassination of Gandhi. So, should the Congress government have removed Savarkarâ€™s picture? There should be no place for ego and hate in a democracy. But since 2014, the way in which minorities and liberals have been attacked by â€˜fringe elementsâ€™ is worrying. Whether it is the killing of Pehlu Khan and Junaid or the brutal attack on Dalits in Una over  â€” it is all giving rise to a culture of hooliganism. In the long run, the RSS/BJP will have to pay for this. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,sports

132,Vipin Pubby,Amarinder Govt @1: CM Cannot Take Peopleâ€™s Goodwill for Granted - The Quint,"A week before the first anniversary of the Congress government led by Captain Amarinder Singh in Punjab, its public relations (PR) department bombarded media with aerial photographs and press releases, admiring his prompt action against the mining mafia in the state. Ironically, the official release and the photographs turned out to be just the evidence of whatâ€™s going wrong with the government. It took an aerial detection of illegal mining, and   the government machinery on the ground, to initiate action against something that was an open secret. It also reflected the disconnect Capt Amarinder Singh, who hardly ventures out to take to the roads, has with ground reality. That contrasts with the style of functioning of his senior and arch rival in politics, former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, who never missed an opportunity to travel and meet people. In his last couple of terms he had left governance to his son and the then deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. The motormouth cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Sidhu is forever bent on embarrassing the government while his Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal is biding his time. Thatâ€™s one big reason why he has been depending on officers for governance. He has delegated powers to senior officers and has been claiming that his job was only to set policy and give directions while it was for the bureaucracy to implement or perish. He had displayed similar traits during his first stint as chief minister between 2002 and 2007. One of the biggest grouses against him had been his dependence on a coterie which controlled information and access to him. Unfortunately, despite the fact that a part of the old coterie has been asked to lie low, it continues to hold sway. Those closely associated with him stress that it was taking too much of the present governmentâ€™s time to set right the rot set in every institution and wing of the government by the previous regime. â€œThe decade-long rule of the Akali-BJP government had severely damaged or diluted the systems,â€ said a close confidante of the chief minister. Giving instances, he said that the Budget was being violated more than being followed, and huge funds were squandered away without maintaining records. He added that mediocrity ruled appointments to various important offices, including constitutional offices, and the current government must bear the legacy. Yet it must be said that although the progress so far is slow and the government is yet to come to grips with myriad problems, some efforts are being made to tackle issues. The chief minister had vowed to â€˜finishâ€™ the problem of drug menace in the state within a month of taking over. Among the other major issues in the state, the huge unemployment problem continues despite a few â€œjob melasâ€ being organised where thousands were claimed to have been provided jobs. Again the claims are seen with suspicion as little has been done to generate employment. One of the most important sections of the society, the farmers, continue to face hardships and little has been done to reduce farm distress. The promised complete loan waiver has not yet been announced and there have been several instances of farmers committing suicide due to failure to repay loans. Capt Amarinder Singh and his government continues to enjoy public goodwill despite the claims of the SAD and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which is now the principal Opposition party. The chief minister, however, cannot afford to take the goodwill for granted and shall have to put in extra effort on the ground to meet the expectations of the public that elected him amid a string of defeats for the Congress across the country.

This legislative reality has in effect led to a deep fissure in the landscape of banking regulatory terrain; a system of dual regulation, by the Finance Ministry in addition to RBI,"" said Urjit Patel.

136,Rahul Nair,BSP founder Kanshi Ramâ€™s Birth Anniversary,"Kanshi Ram is considered the second biggest name of the Dalit movement in Indiaâ€™s political landscape, after Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. Fondly known as Bahujan Nayak or Saheb, Kanshi Ram launched the Bahujan Samaj Party in 1984, which went on to form the government in Indiaâ€™s largest state, Uttar Pradesh on four occasions. Born on 15 March 1934, Kanshi Ram was a Dalit from the Chamar Ramdasia community of Khawaspur village in Ropar district (now Rupnagar), Punjab. He completed his BSc and joined as an assistant Scientist in DRDO in Kirki Pune Maharashtra in 1957. Although his village was free of the stigma of untouchability, Kanshi Ram came face-to-face with caste discrimination while working at the Explosive Research and Development Laboratory (ERDL) in Pune, where the management cancelled Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Jayanti and Buddha Jayanti holidays. It was the struggle to reinstate these two holidays that inspired Kanshi Ram to fight for Dalits. A subsequent reading of Ambedkarâ€™s writings, particularly â€˜The Annihilation of Casteâ€™, instilled pride in his identity and a desire to mobilise Dalits. At first, he worked for the Republican Party of India for eight years, till he became disillusioned by the partyâ€™s functioning. After travelling the length and breadth of the country on cycles to understand Dalitsâ€™ plight, Kanshi Ram formed the All India SC, ST, OBC and Minority Employees Association (BAMCEF) in 1978 â€“ a non-political, non-religious and non-agitational organisation. Later in 1981, he formed the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti (DS4). In 1982 he wrote his book â€˜The Chamcha Age (an Era of the Stooges)â€™ where he lampooned Dalit leaders who, for their own selfish motives, worked for parties like the Congress. On realising the Dalit movement cannot gain momentum without a political base, Kanshi Ram launched the Bahujan Samaj Party in on 14 April 1984, 28 years after Dr Babasaheb Ambedkarâ€™s death. He used the Pali word â€˜Bahujanâ€™ to assimilate all minorities under one banner. In the 1988 Allahabad LS bypolls, Kanshi Ram contested against future Prime Minister VP Singh and lost by 70,000 votes. His bad run continued as he contested from East Delhi (Lok Sabha constituency) in 1989 and came fourth. Fortunes turned when Kanshi Ram finally won the Etawah LS Constituency in 1991; he later won the Hoshiarpur LS Constituency in Punjab in 1996. In 1993, Kanshi Ram joined forces with the Samajwadi Party to form the government in UP. At the onset of the 90s, Kanshi Ram had aggressively campaigned against the Manuwadis and upper castes. But soon he realised the importance of all castes and garnered support from Brahmins, Banias and even the Muslims, thereby effectively wiping out the Congress vote bank in the 90s. In 1995, Mayawati, Kanshi Ramâ€™s protege, become the youngest CM of UP and the first Dalit CM in India. According to Mayawatiâ€™s biographer, when Kanshi Ram visited Mayawatiâ€™s family in 1977 he told her, ""I can make you such a big leader one day that not one, but a whole row of IAS officers will line up for your orders."" The BSP went on to form governments in UP in 1997, 2002 and later a fourth term in 2007 with absolute majority. Kanshi Ram was a diabetic and was plagued by health problems. He suffered a heart attack in 1994, an arterial clot in his brain in 1995, and a stroke in 2003. After the stroke, he was virtually bed-ridden till his death. In 2002, Ram had announced his intention to convert to Buddhism on 14 October 2006, the 50th anniversary of Ambedkar's conversion; however, he died just a few days short, on 9 October 2006, of a severe heart attack. His funeral rites were performed as per Buddhist tradition with Mayawati lighting the pyre, and his ashes were placed in an urn and kept at Prerna Sthal in Noida UP.

138,PTI, Votersâ€™ Anger Showed BJP the Door in UPâ€“Bihar Bypolls: Congress - The Quint,"The Congress on Wednesday said people across the country, angered by the BJP's ""arrogance and misrule"", were ""showing it the door"", as was amply proved by the by-election results in the states. The Congress also claimed the BJP had ""lost"" its simple majority in the Lok Sabha. It said the BJP now had 271 members, minus the two rebel MPs, Kirti Azad and Shatrughan Sinha. Congratulating the winners of the Lok Sabha by-elections, Congress president Rahul Gandhi said the outcomes showed that the people were angry with the BJP and would vote for any non-BJP candidate with the potential to win. He also said the Congress was keen to rebuild the party in Uttar Pradesh but added it would ""not happen overnight"". The party's candidates in the state lost their deposits in the recent by-polls to two Lok Sabha seats, the results of which were announced on Wednesday itself. The Samajwadi Party defeated the BJP in the two constituencies. Congress communications in-charge Randeep Surjewala said the BJP had lost 10 Lok Sabha by-elections in 2017 and 2018. ""In May 2014, the BJP won 282 Lok Sabha seats. In four years, BJP government is down to 271, losing its simple majority in Lok Sabha minus its allies - considering the fact that PM Modi has suspended Kirti Azad and virtually disowned their most truthful, fiercely independent Patna Sahib MP,"" Surjewala tweeted. In another tweet, he named the 10 Lok Sabha seats -- Amritsar, Srinagar, Malappuram, Gurdaspur, Ajmer, Alwar, Uluberia, Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Araria. ""By-poll results have given clear message that people are angry with BJP for its arrogance and misrule,"" he said. Congress spokesperson Jyotiraditya Scindia said the results of the by-polls clearly indicated that across the country, people had spoken out against the ""anti-farmer"" rule of the Central government. He said people had also testified against the BJP government's ""anti-youth policies"", ""anti-women rule"" and ""unemployment that is rampant"". ""It is very clear that the people of our great country are showing this BJP government the door,' he told reporters outside Parliament. Congress general secretary Mohan Prakash said the BJP was facing anti-incumbency sentiments in all states as it was doing exactly the opposite of what it had promised. ""People are now waiting for the 2019 general elections to teach the BJP a lesson,"" he said. The Samajwadi Party on Wednesday won the Phulpur Lok Sabha seat and the Gorakhpur Lok Sabha seats, constituencies vacated by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, respectively. The Bahujan Samaj Party gave its support to the SP in the two seats while the Congress put up its own candidates, who lost their deposits. The BJP also lost the Araria Lok Sabha by-election to the RJD. In the two assembly by-polls in Bihar, the RJD won the Jehanabad Assembly seat while the BJP bagged the Bhabhua Assembly seat.

139,BloombergQuint,â€˜Pained & Angeredâ€™: RBI Gov Breaks His Silence on Banking Frauds - The Quint,"The Governor of the Reserve Bank of India has responded to criticism that the regulator was not alert enough in recent cases of fraud, saying dual regulation owing to the finance ministryâ€™s involvement and weaker market discipline mechanism for public sector banks had a role to play. No banking regulator can catch or prevent all frauds, Patel said, adding that it is infeasible for a banking regulator to be in every nook and corner of banking activity to rule out frauds by â€œbeing thereâ€. I speak today to highlight some fundamental fissures that exist in the regulation of banks, in particular, public sector banks (PSBs). It has been slightly over a month since the latest fraud in the Indian banking sector broke news. Success has many fathers; failures none. Hence, there has been the usual blame game, passing the buck, and a tonne of honking, mostly short-term and knee-jerk reactions. These appear to have prevented the participants in this cacophony from deep reflection and soul searching that can help solve fundamental issues that are the root cause of such frauds and related irregularities in the banking sector, which as I will explain are in fact far too regular. Let me start with what has been at the heart of some of the immediate reactions â€“ the Reserve Bankâ€™s supervision of banks. In its 2017 Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSAP) of India, conducted, completed and released prior to this episode, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB), made the following observations: 1. In the publicly released FSSA (Financial System Stability Assessment) report, Para 35, page 17:  2. Further, in its specific comments on Other Regulation, Accounting, and Disclosure (Core Principles or CPs 20, 26â€“29: Para 60, page 21):  However, the FSAP for India laments at several points the fact that the Reserve Bankâ€™s regulatory powers over banks are not neutral to bank ownership: 1. In the Detailed Assessment Report (DAR) on the Basel Core Principles (BCP) on the Effective Banking Supervision, Para 6, Page 7:   2. Specifically, on Corporate Governance (CP 14, Para 50, page 18):    Let me elaborate. All commercial banks in India are regulated by the RBI under the Banking Regulation (BR) Act of 1949. Additionally, all public sector banks are regulated by the Government of India (GoI) under the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970; the Bank Nationalisation Act, 1980; and the State Bank of India Act, 1955. Section 51 of the amended BR Act explicitly states which portions of the BR Act apply to the PSBs, most common thread across the omissions being complete removal or emaciation of RBI powers on corporate governance at PSBs: This legislative reality has in effect led to a deep fissure in the landscape of banking regulatory terrain: a system of dual regulation, by the Finance Ministry in addition to RBI.  I will now take a few minutes to explain why this fissure or the fault line is bound to lead to tremors such as the most recent fraud. Temptation to engage in fraud at the level of employee or employees is always present, in banks (or in corporations), be it in public sector or private sector. The question then is whether there is adequate deterrence faced by employees from undertaking frauds and enough incentives for management to put in place preventive measures to preempt frauds. In case of banks, three potentially powerful mechanisms could induce discipline against frauds:  Criminal investigation of frauds and attached penalties can serve as an effective deterrence if reporting and investigation are expedient and penalties are adequately severe relative to the gains from fraudulent activity.  Fraudulent activity can be a net loss to the bottom-line; in this case, bank investors would impose deterrence, e.g., uninsured creditors might â€œrunâ€ on the bank inducing liquidity problems, or shareholders might â€œexitâ€, effectively raising the cost of capital and inducing solvency questions. In anticipation of such disruptive outcomes that might cause loss of control, management and board members may put in place governance mechanisms to prevent or reduce the incidence of fraud and/or hold larger buffers in the capital structure to bear losses when fraud materialises.  Banks in most parts of the world, however, have a significant portion of deposit funding that is insured, and since banks serve critical payments and settlements function, they are often too big to fail or too many to fail. Hence, a part of the market discipline is weakened as a tradeoff with financial stability and is substituted by delegation of supervisory and regulatory powers to a banking regulator. Detection and punishment by the regulator then need to be effective to discipline fraud. How do these mechanisms work in case of private and public sector banks in India? Investigative and formal enforcement process takes in our country, perhaps for the right reasons, a fair bit of time. Indeed, RBI data on banking frauds suggests that only a handful of cases over the past five years have had closure, and cases of substantive economic significance remain open. As a result, the overall enforcement mechanism â€“ at least until now â€“ is not perceived to be a major deterrent to frauds relative to economic gains from fraud. It is fair to say that in case of private sector banks, the real deterrence arises from market and regulatory discipline, and their confluence. A private bank CEOâ€™s primary concern is whether s/he will be able to raise capital when the need arises or even whether s/he will still be running the bank the next day. The point is that they could be readily cautioned through their Boards and even replaced by the RBI in case of large or persistent irregularities. Further, a private bank failing to meet bank solvency standards and under RBIâ€™s â€œprompt corrective actionâ€ (PCA) would find it hard to raise capital, whereby it would need to put the house in order at swift notice so it can raise funding from markets and get back to growth path. In turn, there are incentives to invest in governance, so as to limit frauds and regulatory violations, and to respond with alacrity when incidents do arise. In contrast, the market discipline mechanism for public sector banks is appreciably weakercompared to that at private banks. There is implicitly a stronger perceived sovereign guarantee for all creditors of PSBs, and the principal shareholder â€“ the government â€“ has not so far been interested in fundamentally modifying the ownership structure. From an economic standpoint, this weakened market discipline should imply that the government would prefer  regulatory discipline of these banks, not  . However, as I explained above at length, and perhaps since the original idea behind bank nationalisation was complete government control over credit allocation to the economy, the situation in India is exactly the reverse: RBIâ€™s regulatory powers over PSBs are  than those over the private sector banks. The BR Act exemptions for PSBs mean that the one agency â€“ the regulatory â€“ that can respond relatively quickly against banking frauds or irregularities cannot take effective action. Hence, for example, MDs at PSBs find it comfortable to tell media that business will be as usual for them under RBIâ€™s Prompt Corrective Action framework as even if they do not meet the stipulated restrictions of the framework, the ultimate authority over their tenure is with the government and not with the RBI. It is not entirely surprising that there has been a recurring theme in report after report on financial sector reforms in the country that has suggested strengthening of PSB governance through improvement in top management and Board member appointments; or, ownership neutrality in banking regulatory powers; or improving market discipline by considering a variety of diverse ownership structures. Will we let another opportunity to catalyse fundamental reform at PSBs pass by? It is fully transparent what needs to be done. From the RBIâ€™s standpoint, legislative changes to the BR Act that make our banking regulatory powers fully ownership neutral â€“ not piecemeal, but   â€“ is a minimum requirement. It might also be the most readily feasible of these options. Another point is in order before I move to the broader issue of bank stressed assets and their resolution. There has been a tendency in the pronouncements post revelation of the fraud that RBI supervision team should have caught it. While that can always be said ex post with any fraud, it is simply infeasible for a banking regulator to be in every nook and corner of banking activity to rule out frauds by â€œbeing thereâ€. If a regulator could achieve such perfect outcomes, it would effectively imply that the regulator can do anything that banks can do, and by implication, can simply perform the entire banking intermediation activity itself. What is needed is that various mechanisms to deter frauds and other irregularities are in place and have bite so that fraud incidence is low and magnitudes contained. Indeed, frauds have happened at banks in regimes with varied levels of banking regulatory quality and in both public and private banks. In the specific case at hand, the Reserve Bank had identified, based on cyber risk considerations, the exact source of operational hazard â€“through which we understand now the fraud had been perpetrated. In particular, the RBI had issued precise instructions via three circulars in 2016 to enable banks to eliminate the hazard. It turns out ex post the bank had simply not done so. Clearly, the internal processes at the bank failed in allowing the operational hazard to remain in place in spite of clear instructions to close it. As we have stated in RBIâ€™s only press statement on this case to date, this was essentially an operational failure at our second largest public sector bank. The RBI will undertake actions against the bank that it is empowered to but this set is limited under its BR Act powers over PSBs. Indeed, in a recent interview to the Press Trust of India, March 11 2018, the IMF Deputy Managing Director Tao Zhang has reinforced this point along with others I alluded to above: Let me now turn to an issue of greater magnitude and more significance than the most recent banking fraud. Its magnitude is larger than 8 1/2 lakh crores of stressed assets on bank balance-sheets and its significance stems from several practices in promoter-bank credit relationship that need immediate attention. The RBIâ€™s  (Section VII. Frauds, Para 3.36) clarifies that there is a link between bank frauds and this stressed assets problem:     The broad conclusion that has been universally reached is that enterprises in India have over and over again received excessive credit during loan growth cycles, which is followed soon after with repayment problems. Rather than resolving stressed credit problems swiftly, banksâ€“either through loan-level â€œfudgesâ€ or refusal to recognise the true asset quality of the credits â€“ have allowed promoters in charge of enterprises to have a soft landing. This soft landing has comprised of even more bank lending so as to keep the accounts artificially in full repayment on past dues, protracted control for promoters over failed assets, and effectively granting them the ability to divert cash and assets, often outside of our jurisdictional reach. The RBI has been clamping down on the failure to recognise asset quality as non-performing as per its norms by requiring that banks, whose â€œdivergenceâ€ exceeds by 15% of the true non-performing assets as per the norms, disclose the divergence. This should restore some market discipline against such practices, especially in the case of private sector banks. However, ultimately there also needs to be a framework in place for time-bound resolution of the underlying stress in assets that limits the discretion of banks to delay the recognition of stress, ever-green â€œzombieâ€ or living-dead borrowers, and poorly allocate credit. To this end, I wish to present and clarify the rationale behind RBIâ€™s revised framework for prompt recognition and resolution of stressed assets. The framework that was released last month remains somewhat under-appreciated in terms of its importance. So let me lay it out. 1. The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2017, and the subsequent authorisation given by the Government of India therein, has empowered the Reserve Bank to issue directions to the banks for resolution of stressed assets, including referring assets to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 (IBC). The Reserve Bank has taken steps over the last year in this direction, with a focus on reference to the IBC of certain large value stressed accounts, covering approximately 40% of banking sectorâ€™s overall exposure to the stressed assets. 2. The revised framework for resolution of stressed assets released by the Reserve Bank on February 12, 2018 is a step towards taking these initial steps to their natural conclusion and laying down a steady-state approach. The steady-state approach is aimed at ensuring early resolution of stressed assets in a transparent and time-bound manner so that maximum value could be realised by the lenders while also recognising the potential ongoing concern value of stressed assets. As explained below, this approach is a positive step towards strengthening the credit culture in the economy, at both borrowers and banks. 3. Various special schemes for resolution, which were introduced by the RBI in the pre-IBC context, had made the resolution process driven by asset-classification consideration of lenders. In particular, the forbearance that was embedded in the schemes to make it easier for banks to resolve assets became an end in itself with little resolution achieved through deployment of the schemes. 4. The revised framework substitutes for these pre-IBC schemes and does away with forbearance since it delayed resolution. The framework relies instead on the biggest structural reform in the credit system in the country in several decades,  ., the IBC, as an important part of resolution. By employing the IBC as its lynchpin, the framework is intended rightly to ensure that the resolution plan for stressed assets is dictated also, and in fact, primarily, by asset viability considerations. 5. It must be stressed that the revised framework would allow lenders absolute flexibility to put in place any credible resolution plan, as under the pre-IBC schemes, subject to meeting certain implementation conditions (the conditions being necessary to alleviate concerns relating to ever-greening of unviable assets). 6. In particular, in respect of accounts with aggregate exposure greater than Rs. 2,000 crores, the resolution plan would be required to be implemented within 180 days from the date of default, failing which these would be referred under the IBC. This threshold would be brought down only gradually over a period of two years to enable the IBC infrastructure to install in parallel the required capacity to handle more cases. It must be emphasised that IBC itself is a resolution framework, whereby such accounts will have sufficient time (180 days from the date of default plus up to 270 days under the IBC) for effective resolution. 7. It must also be underscored that under the revised framework: In other words, the IBC along with RBIâ€™s revised framework will help break the promoter-bank nexus which has led to crony capitalism and attendant NPA/credit misallocation problem as ever-greening suited some borrowers and some lenders under the earlier framework. In turn, this will prevent the erosion of growth from the emergence of zombie firms and sectors. 8. Finally, the revised framework specifically excludes the revival and rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) with exposures of up to Rs. 25 crore, which shall continue to be covered under the earlier norms. We believe this is precisely the fundamental reform needed in order to strengthen the credit culture at origination, default, asset quality recognition and resolution stages. By so doing, it should weaken in the first place opportunities for engaging in frauds relating to loan advances. I have chosen to speak today to convey that we at the Reserve Bank of India also feel the anger, hurt and pain at the banking sector frauds and irregularities. In plain simple English, these practices amount to a looting of our countryâ€™s future by some in the business community, in cahoots with some lenders. As safeguards of your deposits at banks, and starting with the Asset Quality Review of banks announced by the Reserve Bank in 2015 â€“ since ably conducted by our supervisory teams and as acknowledged objectively by experts of reputed multilateral agencies, we are doing all we can to break this unholy nexus. I see what we have undertaken for cleaning up the credit culture of the country â€“ in particular, the comprehensive regulatory overhaul announced by the Reserve Bank on February 12th for prompt recognition and resolution of NPAs at banks â€“ as the   mount or the churning rod in the   or the   of the modern day Indian economy. Until the churn is complete and the nectar of stability safely secured for the countryâ€™s future, someone must consume the poison that emanates along the way. If we need to face the brickbats and be the   consuming this poison, we will do so as our duty; we will persist with our endeavours and get better with each trial and tribulation along the way. I do wish more promoters and banks, individually â€“ or collectively through their industry bodies, would reconsider being on the side of   rather than   in this  . The owner of our public sector banks â€“ the government â€“which has provided the IBC, the related ordinances and the bank recapitalisation package to get the churn going, might consider making further, equally important contributions by: It is an open issue whether centralised government control alone can be effective enough at designing and implementing governance of banking franchise comprising over 2/3rds of the sectorâ€™s deposits and assets. It would be better instead to restore regulatory and market discipline. These, and other structural reforms to the banking sector, would enable India to grow sustainably at respectable rates.

141,Santosh Pai,"Fight All You Want, Chinaâ€™s Money Will Keep Coming to India - The Quint","China is currently both Indiaâ€™s largest trading partner and fastest growing source of FDI. Despite this, the bulk of Indiaâ€™s governmental engagement with China occurs in the political sphere. In 2017, India-China political relations were dominated by two major events: the Doklam standoff and Indiaâ€™s boycott of the OBOR plan (now renamed as Belt and Road Initiative). The OBOR forum held in May 2017 was viewed as President Xi Jinpingâ€™s show of strength on the global stage in the run up to the Chinese Communist Partyâ€™s 19th Congress in October, where he renewed his term as President. Around 68 countries sent representatives to the forum, including Western powers such as UK and the US. India was the only major country in the world that chose to skip this event completely. However, in reality, Chinese Outbound Direct Investment (ODI) in India actually outpaced its global growth rate in 2017. It also flowed in a concentrated manner into select sectors. This is a paradox that warrants further examination. From 2014 onward, under Modiâ€™s â€˜Make in Indiaâ€™ campaign, Chinese companies have been courted in the hope that they will undertake much needed investments in large scale manufacturing in India and deploy low-cost capital to bridge Indiaâ€™s â€œinfrastructure deficitâ€. In addition to this, a few grandiose projects such as industrial parks and townships have also been floated with little success. While some of these measures have borne fruit the real story of Chinese investments in India is unfolding in completely unrelated sectors where there is barely any role for the government. Chinaâ€™s foreign exchange reserves reached a historical peak of $3.99 trillion in June 2014 and then plummeted down to $2.99 trillion by January 2017. This rapid decline was mainly on account of ODI transactions and precipitated a re-think among Chinese policy makers. As a result, the first half of 2017 witnessed a staggering year-on-year decline of 45.8 percent in global Chinese ODI. This recovered slightly in the second half of 2017 to close the year with an year-on-year drop of 29.4 percent owing to relaxations made in the new regulatory framework. Until 2015, Chinese investors were absent in large investment deals (larger than $100 million) in India. Thatâ€™s when a couple of such deals were closed by Chinaâ€™s Alibaba ($500 million in Snapdeal and $700 million in Paytm). This was the same time when the number of smartphone users as a percentage of mobile phone users in India crossed 25 percent â€“ a milestone that had triggered growth in Chinaâ€™s own e-commerce market several year ago. This trend continued in 2016, when Chinaâ€™s Tencent invested $150 million in Hike, a messaging app. In the same year a consortium of Chinese investors paid $900 for   making it the single largest investment from China in India ever. Thus within two years the digital industry emerged as the largest recipient of Chinese investments in India. The surge in Chinese investments in India continued unabated within the digital industry in 2017. Alibaba and Tencent alone announced or closed deals valued close to two billion dollars. Alibabaâ€™s investments included a second tranche of $177 million in Paytm, $150 million in Zomato, $100 million in FirstCry and $200 million in Big Basket. Tencentâ€™s investments included $400 million in Ola, $700 million in Flipkart and a second round of investment in Practo. Apart from these deals in the internet industry, 2017 also witnessed a blockbuster deal in the pharmaceutical space when Fosun spent $1.09 billion acquiring a 74 percent stake in Indiaâ€™s Gland Pharma. This deal took more than a year to complete. The original target of 96 percent was whittled down to 86 percent and the deal was finally closed at 74 percent to obviate the need for government approval. The fact that Chinese ODI flow to India was not impacted by two significant negative political events in 2017 is an indicator of its strong resilience. It is also perhaps evidence that India still remains an under-invested jurisdiction for Chinese ODI relative to other markets. While Indian startups are grateful for the entry of Chinese venture capitalists, there are large sections of Indiaâ€™s more traditional industries which still remain skeptical about whether to view China as an economic foe or a partner. In the final analysis, it is the wallet of the Indian consumer that speaks the loudest and continues to draw Chinese ODI to India. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

Maldivian Minister for Fisheries and Agriculture Mohammad Shainee made the statement in the Maldivian capital, Male, adding that the political crisis in the country is â€œlike Kashmir, an internal matter,â€    . The Maldives was   in February 2018, when the Supreme Court passed an order that reinstated 9 opposition MPs who were removed from the countryâ€™s Parliament, including exiled former President Mohamed Nasheed, in an order dated 1 February. In response to the Supreme Courtâ€™s order, President Abdulla Yameen declared a state of emergency in the country on 5 February. He then had two Supreme Court judges arrested, one being the countryâ€™s Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed. Just days later, the countryâ€™s Supreme Court reversed its 1 February order. After a request from exiled President Mohamed Nasheed, and mounting international pressure asking India to intervene  , Indiaâ€™s MEA called on the Maldives to implement the Supreme Courtâ€™s order, and â€œrestore the normal functions of the institutions of democracy.â€ In response to President Yameen extending the state of emergency by 30 days on 22 February, India had said that it saw   of the Emergency. The statement from the Maldivian Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, comes in response to Indiaâ€™s assertion that it was â€œwatching the situation closely,â€ and that the Maldives should return to a state of normalcy. Shainee also said that â€œa third partyâ€ had begun mediating negotiations to resolve the political crisis, when asked what role India is expected to play now. He added that the mediator was neither India nor China, in light of multiple allegations from exiled President Mohamed Nasheed that the Maldives had grown closer to China. Shainee also dismissed questions about allowing two Chinese warships to dock in Maldivian waters in 2017, stating that the archipelago nation had also hosted warships of the US and the UAE in its waters, and that this shouldnâ€™t be taken to mean anything more.

145,Mayank Mishra,"Gorakhpur, Phulpur & Araria Show An Acceleration in BJPâ€™s Downfall - The Quint","Cracks were all too visible. The first clear sign of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) losing the script in politically significant Uttar Pradesh came to the fore when results of the civic poll were announced in December. Nearly 3.4 crore voters, roughly 20% of all voters of the state, were asked to elect 652 heads of three-tier urban local bodies. The BJP could win 184 of the 652 seats on offer. The winning percentage, therefore, stood at a very modest 28%. What is more, for the posts of nagar panchayat heads in semi-urban areas, the BJP could win a mere 100 of the 438 seats on offer, with a success rate of just 23%. The BJPâ€™s vote share was close to 30 percent, down 10 percent from the lofty levels obtained in the 2014 Lok Sabha and 2017 assembly elections. While the BJP did well in large urban centres, the performance dipped considerably in areas closer to the countryside. However, BJPâ€™s spin doctors and friendly press projected the verdict as a landslide for the saffron party. It was anything but a landslide, creating a sense of complacency, perhaps, among leaders and workers. Wednesdayâ€™s results have shown that the slide has only accelerated now. And let us remember that Gorakhpur and Phulpur are no ordinary Lok Sabha seats. Gorakhpur has elected a BJP leader in all six Lok Sabha elections since 1991. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has represented that constituency for five consecutive terms beginning in 1998. And heads of Gorakhnath Peeth (Adityanath and his predecessors) have won the seat 10 out of 17 times since Independence. Gorakhpur, a laboratory of aggressive Hindutva, therefore has been one of safest seats for the BJP in almost all elections. Phulpur, on the other hand, was an example of how the Modi magic could decisively tilt the balance in favour of the BJP in places where the saffron party had limited presence. Phulpur has had a history of electing non-BJP leaders in all elections except in 2014. While it was a Congress stronghold till the 1980s, the Mandalisation of politics in the Hindi heartland saw the ascendance of the Samajwadi Party in the constituency once held by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The Modi wave, however, ensured the victory of Keshav Prasad Maurya, now the deputy chief minister of UP, in the 2014 general election. Does a loss of nearly 3.5 lakh votes since then mean that the Modi magic is diminishing? Araria, a Lok Sabha constituency in neighbouring Bihar, has been a stronghold of the BJP whenever it has fought the election in alliance with Nitish Kumarâ€™s Janata Dal (United). Despite the social equation favouring Lalu Prasadâ€™s Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) as Muslims and Yadavs constitute nearly 50 percent of the population in the area, RJD candidates lost four of the five recent Lok Sabha elections here. Nitish Kumarâ€™s perceived secular credentials used to ensure that the RJDâ€™s so-called Muslim-Yadav combination would not work. A victory for RJD here means that the seemingly formidable alliance of the JD (U) and the BJP is not all that formidable now. And the RJDâ€™s MY combination seems to be back to its winning ways. There are three clear messages coming out of the bypoll results. First, there is a fatigue among the people over the aggressive espousal of Hindutva in all its variants. A loss for the BJP in Gorakhpur makes that loud and clear. Two, the kind of Modi wave we witnessed in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections seems to be sliding downhill, at least in areas where the people have had first-hand experience of how BJP governments perform. The message from Phulpur is precisely that. And a loss in Araria means that the BJPâ€™s tried and tested allies, the JD(U) in this case, may not bring as much value to the table as it used to do in the past.

The two accused were identified as Shiva and Mahesh, while the police said that one B Naveen was apprehended even as he was allegedly fleeing the crime scene. One more accused is said to still be on the run. The police said a petty issue that had gotten out of hand resulted in Sudheer's murder. Refusing to back down, Sudheer and his elder brother later went and thrashed Krishna and his two friends, Mahesh and Naveen, following which a humiliated Mahesh planned to kill Sudheer, the police said. The three arrested were sent to judicial custody, and the weapons used were also taken in as evidence. At around 8.20 am on March 12, Sudheer and his friend Sai, were knocked down near the Kukatpally Metro Station by four armed men. Sudheer tried to run and even got on a school bus to escape the assailants. Before anyone could comprehend the situation, the armed gang pulled Sudheer down and attacked him with machetes. According to the police, Sudheer died almost immediately due to the deep cuts on his neck and his head.

147,The Quint,â€˜Bihar Bypoll  Victory a Result of Laluâ€™s Ideologyâ€™: TejashwiÂ  - The Quint," Sandeep Suman The Bharatiya Janta Party-led NDA suffered an electoral shock in three Lok Sabha bypolls in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Wednesday managed to retain Jehanabad seat as well as the Araria Lok Sabha seat in Bihar, while, the saffron party clinched the Bhabua assembly seat. Dedicating the win to the people of Bihar, RJD chiefâ€™s son and party leader Tejashwi Yadav called the results â€˜a victory of the ideology of Lalu Prasad Yadav.â€™ The bypolls were considered the first electoral test after Nitish Kumar dumped the Grand Alliance and joined hands with the BJP last year. Yadav also slammed the Nitish Kumar-led NDA government calling it an â€œopportunistic alliance.â€ Yadav on 14 March took jibes at the saffron party, saying he expects more ED and CBI actions now. The for a Grand Alliance at the national level to defeat the BJP and said there was a need for opposition leaders to shed their ego. â€œA grand Alliance is the demand of time, it is the demand of the people. Keep your ego away,â€ Yadav added. He said the Samajwadi Party and the BSP should fight the 2019 Lok Sabha polls together and urged the Congress to join them in driving the political discourse in the right direction. The former Deputy Chief Minister, who led the RJD campaign as his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad is in jail, said his party's social support base was intact. Manjhi had recently joined the grand alliance after walking away from NDA government. Reacting to the results, former Chief Minister of Bihar Jitan Ram Manjhi said, â€œBJP should stop working for its face value and instead put in efforts to work for the people.

148,Srishti Tyagi,Right-Wing Groups Pick On Muslim Family for â€˜Land Jihadâ€™ in UP - The Quint,"A Muslim family was not allowed to move into their house in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, which they had recently bought, as Hindus living in the neighbourhood opposed their moving in. Local right-wing groups like the Bajrang Dal and the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha accused them of committing â€˜land jihad'. Senior Superintendent of Police Manzil Saini promised to protect the Muslim family if they decide to move in â€“ but are the conditions in Meerutâ€™s Maliwada too hostile for Usman Ahmad and his family to live in their own house? We travelled to ground zero to find out.   Nauman Ahmad works as a software engineer in Delhi, but is originally from Meerut. His family lives in Maliwada in Meerut, where they have been living for the last 30 years. He grew up here in a single room accommodation provided by the government-aided Ismail Public School along with his brother, Usman, and three sisters. Naumanâ€™s father works at the school. His family bought a house in Maliwada, about a kilometre from their old house. They bought the house from Sanjay Rastogi, who runs a telecom business, for Rs 28.30 lakh, of which they took a bank loan of Rs 18 lakh. But some other residents feel differently in the communal atmosphere. Balraj Dungar said the term â€˜land jihadâ€™ is not new, and has been prevalent for a long time now. He said that Muslims buy houses in Hindu localities as a part of a larger conspiracy. Usman's family has been promised that they will get the money back by 17 February 2018. Either the previous owner Rastogi will have to return the amount or the neighbours will have to find Hindus to buy the house at the same price. On their part, police have kept their distance from the ratcheting communal tension. Usmanâ€™s family continue to live in the very same one-room accommodation they were always living in â€“ with the added burden of paying bank EMIs. They might never get to move to their new, rightful house for fear of hostile neighbours and hostile right-wing groups that have descended on their private land dealings.

That was the clear message from state education minister, Partha Chatterjee, who was responding to an incident that happened in South Kolkataâ€™s Kamala Girlsâ€™ High School. Students and parents of the school have alleged that twelve girls of the ninth standard were threatened with expulsion, because they were displaying â€œlesbian behaviourâ€.

150,Aviral Virk,UP By- Election: Consolidating Nishad Vote Key to Winning Gorakhpur UP,"Akhilesh Yadavâ€™s invitation to Praveen Kumar Nishad to contest the Gorakhpur bypoll on a Samajwadi Party (SP) ticket will be seen as a political masterstroke coupled with the tactical alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The bypoll was necessitated after Yogi Adityanath â€“ a five-time Bharatiya Janata Party MP from Gorakhpur â€“ was appointed as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017. The contest wouldâ€™ve been considered a foregone conclusion had it not been for Yadavâ€™s decision to pit Nishad of the NISHAD Party against the BJPâ€™s Upendra Dutt Shukla. At around 11:30 am, the SP wrested the lead from the BJP in a seat thatâ€™s been the latterâ€™s bastion for the last 25 years. The neck and neck contest was over by 1 pm, when the Samajwadi Party made good on its lead, by about 14,000 votes. Praveen Kumar Nishad is the son of Dr Sanjay Nishad, the president of the NISHAD (Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal) Party, which was founded only in 2016. The party represents the dominant boating community of Gorakhpur. A protege of Kanshi Ram, Dr Nishad left the BSP to form the NISHAD Party just ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections and fielded candidates in all the seats in alliance with three other regional parties â€“ Peace Party (led by Mohammad Ayyub), Apna Dal (Krishna Patel faction) and Jan Adhikar Party (founded by sacked BSP leader and National Rural Health Mission scam accused Babu Singh Kushwaha). According to a   in  , in the 2017 Assembly polls, the NISHAD Party secured 5.40 lakh votes in the 72 seats it contested, mostly in Purvanchal (eastern Uttar Pradesh). A prominent OBC caste, the Nishads form 14 percent of the stateâ€™s population and are believed to have voted for the BJP en bloc in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Their livelihoods are primarily linked to the river and many of them are boatmen with surnames like Kewat, Bind, Mallah and Manjhi. Nishads, along with the Kurmis and Kushwahas have been crucial to the BJPâ€™s UP strategy, which rests on wooing non-Yadav OBCs. In Gorapkhpur alone, there are about three lakh members belonging to the Nishad community, making them the second largest community after the Brahmins. On paper, the SP+ BSP + Nishad Party + Peace Party alliance brought together an unbeatable combination of Yadav + Dalit + non-Yadav OBC and Muslim votes. In the first two elections won by him in 1998 and 1999, Adityanath was up against Samajwadi Partyâ€™s Jamuna Nishad. According to an Election Commission report, in his maiden election, Adityanath won by . In 1999, however, the margin was reduced to   only. During subsequent elections in 2004 and 2009, however, the Nishad votes got distributed when, along with the SP, the BSP also fielded a Nishad candidate, Pradeep Kumar Nishad. In 2014, Adityanath defeated Rajmati Nishad, wife of Jamuna Nishad by more than 3 lakh votes. Ram Bhuwal Nishad, who was with the BSP at the time (now with SP) secured 1,76,412 votes. As of 3:30 pm, SPâ€™s Praveen Kumar Nishad was leading by 28,737 votes against the BJPâ€™s Upendra Dutt Shukla, whose candidature incidentally, was announced before the SP-NISHAD Party alliance was formalised. This was the first election in which a representative of the Gorakhpeeth did not represent the BJP in Gorakhpur. Adityanath succeeded his mentor Mahant Avaidyanath who held the seat prior to 1998.

152,Chandan Nandy,"11 Years on, Poverty-Stricken Nandigram No More Mamataâ€™s Priority - The Quint","Eleven years ago, on this day, 14 March, when 14 farmers were killed in police firing in East Midnaporeâ€™s Nandigram, the politics of West Bengal, by then in the loosening grip of the CPI(M)-led Left Front regime, was set to change forever. Coupled with its penchant and support for violent ways, not just in Nandigram but also Singur in Hooghly district, the Trinamool Congress under Mamata Banerjee had found its political raison dâ€™etre. From here on, she and her party would become a virtually unstoppable force in a moribund state, crying for industrialisation and employment generation, especially in the rural hinterland where agriculture still held sway, but was becoming increasingly non-viable as a means of economic livelihood. Today, Nandigram continues to remain a rural backwater in East Midnaporeâ€™s Haldia sub-division, which years ago was showcased by the Left Front, as an island that promised economic growth marked by the CPI(M)-led governmentâ€™s belated decision to expand the special economic zone (SEZ) in the coastal belt. The TMCâ€™s opposition to the Left Front governmentâ€™s land acquisition programme in Singur and Nandigram had catapulted Mamata. Yet today, into her second term as chief minister, Mamata and her party make symbolic gestures of salutations to the men who lost their lives in Nandigram on 14 March 2007. Local party leaders such as Nandigram MLA Subhendu Adhikari go through the motions of social programmes that honour the â€œvalourâ€ of the â€œmartyrsâ€, but not much else. The chief minister has visited sundry countries in the West and Southeast Asia to â€œinviteâ€ investors to her state. These foreign visitations have not been marked with any success. Her government has, from time to time, promised that land could be given to Indian and foreign industrialists from a â€œland bankâ€ in other parts of the state. Nandigram and Singur would remain no-go zones, for these remain â€œsacredâ€ to the TMCâ€™s politics. But Nandigram and Singur, and the TMCâ€™s politics over these two places separated by a distance of 145 km, also represent a problem for Mamata. Political observers in Kolkata opine that while Mamata realises the dire need of industrialisation in Bengal, she knows too, that throwing open Nandigram and Singur to potential investors could spell political doom. It would be akin to losing a large and decisive vote bank. With the leftist parties in terminal decline and the Congress relegated to a small corner in two or three districts in North Bengal, Mamataâ€™s battle lines are drawn. The BJP is the new threat that her party, mired in allegations of financial scandals that have sprung from allegations that individual party leaders, benefited from the Sarada and Rose Valley chit fund scams, is having to contend with. More importantly, in the face of the BJPâ€™s politics that brands the TMC as a party that is â€˜softâ€™ towards the Muslims (who constitute about 28 percent of the population in West Bengal), Mamata has been busy, not only consolidating the minority vote, but has also made subtle overtures to sections of caste Hindus who, she fears, could easily come under the BJPâ€™s spell. As part of its larger political strategy, the West Bengal BJP has also been harping about the TMC governmentâ€™s inability to usher in economic development. So far, the BJP has not unveiled an alternative plan to economically rejuvenate Bengal, and has shied away from attacking Mamataâ€™s government by not referring to Nandigram which has a sizeable Muslim population. On the other hand, Mamataâ€™s advantage in the region is two-fold: While most of the farmers who lent their support to the TMC in the aftermath of the police firing have, so far, stood solidly behind her party, a bulk of them also are Muslims who, in the face of the BJPâ€™s Hindutva politics, would continue to solidly back the ruling dispensation. In the 2016 assembly elections, the TMC captured 13 of the 16 seats in East Midnapore, with the rest going to the Left. One measure of the TMCâ€™s political clout in the district is that party nominee Subhendu Adhikari, who had led the Nandigram movement, won by a huge margin, despite being under a cloud of suspicion for his alleged involvement in the Saradha chit fund scam and subsequently in a bribery allegation allegedly exposed by the Narada sting. Today, Adhikari is under Mamataâ€™s instructions to lie low, but he continues to be an asset for the TMC at a time when others, such as Mukul Roy, have abandoned the party and gone over to the BJP.

153,Vishnu Gopinath,What Did Haseeb Drabu Say on J&K That Cost Him His Ministership? - The Quint,"Former Jammu and Kashmir finance minister Haseeb Drabu broke his silence on his unceremonious exit from the Mehbooba Mufti government, on Tuesday, 13 March. Mufti sacked the senior PDP leader from her Council of Ministers on Monday, 12 March, over parts of a speech that Drabu made at the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry in New Delhi on 9 March. The 57-year-old former journalist issued a three-page statement on his sacking, minutes after Chief Minister Mufti gave additional charge of finance and labour to Education Minister Syed Mohammed Altaf Bukhari. The decision was a ""surprise"" and the manner in which it was conveyed was ""shocking,"" he said. In his statement, Drabu said the decision to ""drop me did come as a surprise but what was shocking was the manner and method of communicating it.â€ In his speech in New Delhi, Drabu had said that unrest in the Valley was not a political issue and that it needed a resolution at the social level by each individual member of civil society.

Wrapping up his speech, the former J&K minister said that if people did not want to hear news about conflict in the valley, the media wouldnâ€™t report it. Concluding his speech, Drabu asked investors to look at J&K as â€œindividuals, not investors,â€ assuring them that if they did so, they would find plenty of good opportunities to invest in.

Never before has an â€œinvincibleâ€ leadership got so soundly thrashed on its home turf within one year of a record-breaking triumph. So... I will now leave it to my worthy colleagues to dissect and trisect the voting data from todayâ€™s eye-rubbing Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Araria bypolls (read along with the recent Gujarat Assembly, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh bypolls). But I would like to move on toâ€¦ Statistics can often be stranger than fiction. Hereâ€™s a political quiz that I am sure most of you will flunk. Before I pose the question, letâ€™s agree on the benchmark: No quarrel up to this point, right? If a politician gets re-elected with the largest increase in his mandate, that should, incontrovertibly, allow him to claim the mantle of â€œbeing the most successfulâ€, right? Okay, now that the ground rules of our quiz have been defined, hereâ€™s the   (million dollar) question: Who can claim to be Indiaâ€™s most successful prime minister? You have three chances to give the correct answer. So here goes: Pandit Nehru? No. Although he got re-elected more than once, he did not appreciably increase his (already awesome) mandate over his respective previous tenures.  Indira Gandhi? No, she got re-elected after she cut short her tenure in 1971, but added   36 percent (from 259 in 1967 to 352 seats) to her previous mandate.  Atal Bihari Vajpayee? No, he got re-elected in 1999, but the BJPâ€™s numbers in parliament hardly budged. Three chances up, guys, you failed to give the right answer. Itâ€™s now Computer   turn. And the   (correct answer), hold your breath, is Dr Manmohan Singh! He got re-elected in 2009 by increasing his previous mandate of 2004 by a gravity-defying 45 percent (from 141 to 206 seats). Hey hey, please exhale before you choke. And yes, give it up for Dr Manmohan Singh, widely described as Indiaâ€™s   prime minister, but who, on cold quantitative stats, can justifiably claim to be the biggest success in that office. I told you, statistics can be stranger than fiction. Post 1991, ie the post liberalisation and coalition era, India has had six general elections. While the polls of 1996, 1998 and 1999 have been analysed and modeled to death by the pundits, the 2009 one has stayed, relatively in the shadows. And thatâ€™s been a mystery to me, because look at just a few of the political discontinuities it threw up: Most pundits have trotted out the rather obvious analyses for the Congressâ€™ amazing re-election in 2009. The two most quoted reasons are the 3 continuous years of 9 percent+ GDP growth and the farm loan waiver just before the voting. I concede that these were the   causes of Congressâ€™s victory. But very short shrift is given to what, in my opinion, was the   reason, ie, that people simply loved Singhâ€™s act of political defiance over the Indo-US Nuclear Deal. They saw in him a status quo-defying politician who could herald change on a massive scale for an electorate tired of clichÃ©-spewing leaders.  Unfortunately for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his Left coalition partners saw red over the Indo-US Nuclear Agreement, and withdrew support in Parliament, pushing the government into minority. Singhâ€™s own Congress party baulked. Opposing spin masters tried to paint Singh as an â€œAmerican lackeyâ€ who was also â€œanti-Muslimâ€. But he stood firm. He had pulled off a diplomatic coup which enhanced Indiaâ€™s soft and hard power across the globe. He sought a vote of confidence in parliament for his minority government. Some deft political management saw the Congress get new allies on board, including Samajwadi Party. Three young Muslim MPs from across the aisle â€“ MIMâ€™s Owaisi, PDPâ€™s Mehbooba Mufti and NCâ€™s Omar Abdullah â€“ supported the government, effectively neutralising the â€œanti-Muslimâ€ thrust. Very few understood, or cared, about the nuclear nuance. What they latched on to was Singhâ€™s ability to stand up to blackmail in the pursuit of modernity and change. Alas, the Congress misread its mandate and harked back to the stasis of garibi hatao (poverty) politics, handing a neat walk-over to Narendra Modi in 2014, who instinctively understood the political message of 2009 better than the victors themselves. With demonic energy, Modi amplified Singhâ€™s incipient bravado into a political hurricane of â€œachche dinâ€ (good days), the promise of transformational change. The rest is history. As Prime Minister Modi and Opposition challenger Rahul Gandhi get ready to square off in 2019, they must internalise what the electorate has been screaming in their ears across the general elections of 2009 and 2014, state elections of Tripura and North East a fortnight back, and the bypolls of Alwar, Ajmer, Madhya Pradesh, Gorakhpur, Phulpur, and Araria: But we were let down by both Manmohan Singh and Narendra Modi.

Deb also visited Bhagirath Para, another village in the Dhalai district, to check the implementation of the centrally-sponsored schemes there. However, the roads, household toilets, and the kitchen of a local Anganwadi centre were found in poor condition.

158,The Quint,Sukma Attack: 9 CRPF Personnel Killed in Chhattisgarh in a suspected Naxal attack,"Nine personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed in an IED blast, when suspected Maoists blew up their mine-protected vehicle (MPV) in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district on Tuesday, 13 March, an official told PTI. Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh, on Wednesday, 14 March, said that the Maoists were attacking in panic. On Tuesday, 13 March, DM Awasthi, Special Director General, Anti-Naxal Operations, told ANI that a patrolling party was going from Kistaram to Palodi in an anti-landmine vehicle, which was targeted by Maoists. Additional forces reached the spot soon after the attack. Six CRPF jawans were also reportedly injured in the explosion, of which four are said to be critical, ANI reported. The blast occurred when a team of CRPF's 212th Battalion was patrolling in a forest in Kistaram area of Sukma, located around 500 km from Raipur, a paramilitary official told PTI. ""Nine paramilitary personnel, belonging to the 212th Battalion, were killed in the blast,"" he added. President Ram Nath Kovind, in a Tweet, condemned the attack on the CRPF jawans, stating that India remains â€œfirm in its resolve to combat terror in all its forms.â€ Prime Minister Narendra Modi also expressed grief and said, â€œIndia salutes the brave CRPF personnel who were martyred in the attack in Sukma, Chhattisgarh.â€ Home Minister Rajnath Singh also condemned the attack that left nine jawans dead, adding that heâ€™d instructed the Director General of the CRPF to fly to Sukma immediately. The security men were conducting an area-domination operation in the forest of Kistaram when the Maoists blew up the CRPF's mine-protected vehicle, a CRPF official told PTI. The injured personnel are being airlifted to Raipur, the official added. The rebels used a lot of explosives to blow up the vehicle, a state police official to PTI. Officials added that the first encounter between the two sides took place at 8 am and later this contingent was targeted by the Maoists. Soon after the incident, reinforcements were rushed to the spot, an official told PTI, adding that further details were awaited. Twelve personnel of the force were killed on March 11 last year in the Bheji area of the district and their arms looted when Naxals ambushed their patrol party. A few days later on 24 April, 25 personnel of the paramilitary were killed in a similar ambush in Sukma. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

159,Reuters,Donald Trump Ousts Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State,"After US President Donald Trump fired Rex Tillerson as the Secretary of State on Tuesday, 13 March, replacing his chief diplomat with loyalist CIA Director Mike Pompeo, the former Secretary of State addressed a press conference saying that his tenure will terminate on 31 March and he will delegate the responsibilities of office to Deputy Secretary Sullivan. Departing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said his department ""exceeded the expectations of almost everyone"" on North Korea. He said there was more to be done with regard to stabilizing Iraq, defeating Islamic militants, dealing with Russia and forging a way forward with China. Tillerson added that ""nothing is possible without allies and partners."" The biggest shakeup of Trump's Cabinet since he took office more than a year ago, which the president announced on Twitter, comes as the administration prepares for an unprecedented meeting with the leader of North Korea. Trump tapped the CIA's Deputy Director Gina Haspel to replace Pompeo at the intelligence agency. Tillersonâ€™s departure caps months of tensions between the president and the 65-year-old former Exxon Mobil chief executive. Tillerson declined to directly address whether he had made the comment, although a State Department spokeswoman later issued a denial. A senior White House official said Trump asked Tillerson to step down on Friday, but did not want to make it public while he was on a trip to Africa. Trump's announcement came only a few hours after Tillerson landed in Washington after a trip that had been cut short. Tillerson had no diplomatic or political experience before becoming secretary of state. He appeared out of the loop last week when Trump announced he would meet with North Korea's Kim. Tillerson joined a long list of senior officials who have either resigned or been fired since Trump took office in January 2017. Others include strategist Steve Bannon, national security adviser Michael Flynn, FBI director James Comey, White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, health secretary Tom Price, communications directors Hope Hicks and Anthony Scaramucci, economic adviser Gary Cohn, and press secretary Sean Spicer.

160,Aviral Virk,UP Bypolls: Media Told to Get Out of Gorapkhpur Counting Centre ,"The by-election to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanathâ€™s Lok Sabha constituency is witnessing a neck-and-neck contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Samajwadi Party (SP). Counting trends as of noon indicate that the SP's Praveen Kumar Nishad is leading with 44,979 votes, while the BJP's Upendra Dutt Shukla trails with 43,456 votes. The district magistrate has reportedly ordered reporters to keep out of the counting centre, provoking furore in the state assembly which is currently in session. The issue of the media being kept out of the counting centre was raised in the Vidhan Sabha by SPâ€™s Ram Govind Chaudhary. The ruckus prompted the speaker to adjourn the assembly for 10 minutes until 12:20 pm. As per reports on ground, the results of the successive rounds of counting are being withheld from the media. However, the Election Commission has rebuffed reports of the media not being allowed to enter the counting centre despite having valid EC passes. In a statement to ANI, the EC said, â€œMedia is inside counting campus since morning. Media is being briefed personally by DM regarding each roundâ€™s progress.â€ SP leader Naresh Uttam Patel has written to the State Chief Election Officer alleging that the district administration is working in favour of the BJP candidate. Patel also protested against mediapersons reportedly being removed from the counting centre in Gorakhpur. Earlier, Gorakhpur District Magistrate Rajeev Rautela told ANI that the process by which the numbers are declared is time consuming. The Assistant Returning Officer collects the numbers from the five assembly constituencies which are then scrutinised by the Returning Officer and two observers who then manually and digitally sign it, he clarified.

On 18 February, 2018, two security personnel were killed and six injured in a gun battle with Maoists in Sukma district,    . There were reactions on social media condemning the attack. For the first time in a decade, 2017 reported less than 1,000 Maoist incidents,     on 31 December 2017. The decline in these incidents is because of â€œattrition of various level cadres of Maoists and the other to the possibility of Maoists deliberately lying low,â€ according to a senior official of the Union Home Ministry. About 300 naxals were killed by security forces in Chhattisgarh over the last two years since 2016, the stateâ€™s home minister, Ramsewak Paikra, told the Legislative Assembly on 21 February,    . Chhattisgarh reported more incidents (41 percent) and deaths (49 percent) than any other state (41 percent) in 2017, according to official data. Over nine years to 2017, as many as 2,811 terrorist incidents were reported in Jammu and Kashmir; 497 security forces have been killed, according to Home Ministry data.

Defining the concept of contract farming as a â€œpre-production season agreement between farmers (individually or collectively) and industryâ€, the Union Ministry, in its communication, says the provisions of the proposed law have been aimed at â€œbuilding a win-win frameworkâ€ for the two principal parties. Once contracts are entered into between the parties, the risk of post-harvest market unpredictability will get transferred from the farmers to the industry.

163,Rajdeep Sardesai,â€˜A Journalist Should Not be a Netaâ€™: Rajdeep Sardesai - The Quint,"Should journalists enter Rajya Sabha on a political party ticket? That's a question that gnaws at me after Kumar Ketkar, a friend and early mentor, became the Congress candidate from Maharashtra and the latest journalist to bite into the tempting political apple. While anyone is free to join politics or be an MP, I just wonder whether an RS seat in particular is increasingly seen as a 'reward' for 'services' rendered. The Upper House membership is afflicted by cronyism and deal making â€“ quid pro quos for favours, past and present, are the order of the day. Media owners-turned-netas are even more culpable in this regard, allowing their news channels and newspapers to be shamelessly used by those in political office. Which is why to see Kumar, who is one of our finest journalist intellects, joining the Rajya Sabha evokes mixed feelings. At one level, he will add to to the diminishing intellectual capital of Parliament but at another level it leaves him in danger of being further compromised since questions will be raised over whether he was using his role as a TV talking head and writer to fuel any political ambition. To be fair, for some time now, Kumar has been firmly convinced that the BJP under Narendra Modi is a fascist party that must be defeated and the Congress is the only viable option. The Kumar I know is no sycophant: he is also not the kind who would have lobbied for an RS seat at any stage unlike many others from my profession who have conveniently shifted their ideology only to stay on the 'right' side of those in power (a prominent editor who once condemned Hindutva politics routinely is now a minister in Mr Modi's government). Moreover, there is probably nothing like a 'neutral' journalist, so wearing his political beliefs on his sleeve is his right as a private citizen. Net net: journalists don't enjoy the luxury of lawyers who can afford to wear two hats without compromising their professional integrity at some level. Once a journalist enters the political domain, he or she sheds any pretence at independent journalism. However, one must also make a distinction between journalist/editors and those who hold constitutional posts dependent on public funding. In my view, army chiefs or Supreme Court judges or election commissioners or anyone who holds a constitutional post must take a minimum two year hiatus before accepting any political role. The number of government functionaries who have swiftly moved to take up political positions is troubling: a journalist, especially someone like Kumar who was a freelancer over the last few years, is, to that extent, free to be guided by individual beliefs and persuasions. Having said all this, I am not sure how a backbencher RS MP can actually contribute meaningfully to public life (many of them scarcely get to speak). Knowing Kumar, though, I am sure he will continue to speak out on issues close to his heart. We have lost a combative journalist of stature, hopefully we will gain an active MP who will represent Parliament with honour and dignity. Let's wish him well and wait to see who the next journalist/media owner to make the shift is. By the way, someone asked me whether I was queuing up to be a RS MP (on Twitter, be prepared to be asked anything by anyone). My direct playful answer: no thanks, I already have an RS as my initials! A few years ago, when a regional party chieftain asked me to enter the Rajya Sabha from their party, my answer was a polite: thank you, but no thank you. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

164,Sanjiv Krishan Sood,"Dropout Rate in CRPF, BSF Increases & Bureaucracy Is To Blame - The Quint","Minister of State for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju informed Lok Sabha on 6 March 2018, that over the last three years, as many as 27,862 personnel and officers of the Central Armed Forces have quit service either by way of voluntary retirement or through resignation. Based on the reply of the minister, the press information bureau has released the following figures of attrition among these armed forces during the last three years and up to 31 January 2018. The reasons stated by the minister for such heavy attrition are personal and domestic, including children or family issues, health or illness of the person or his family and social or family obligations. He also stated that some personnel also sought voluntary retirement to enjoy a static life as well as pension benefits after completing 20 years of service. Interestingly, replies to similar questions asked almost every year for the last few years have also been along the same predictable lines. Moreover, an analysis of the data above brings out some facts which need to be considered seriously to retain such skilled talent that has been honed at heavy cost to the exchequer. It would be seen that the rate of voluntary retirement among the other ranks has jumped by almost four times in 2017 as compared to 2015. In case of the BSF and CRPF, the increase, at almost 12 and 6 times respectively, is     alarming. Similar trends can be seen in the figures pertaining to officers and subordinate officers. Such heavy increase in attrition during the times when jobs in open market are not easily available needs some serious analysis. The fact that so many officers, subordinate officers and other ranks opt to resign from a relatively better paid job after a short spell in service points towards a deeper malady. Service conditions of the paramilitary personnel are such that they are always deployed from one active area to another, unlike the Army, which alternately goes from field to peace and vice-versa. The troops in BSF have actually internalised the situation and jokingly say that the periodic changeover exercise of units actually changes nothing but only the numbers on Border Pillars. Similar is the situation with other border guarding forces. CRPF units are continuously deployed in areas facing internal security threats, with no time for re-organising and refitting. This disrupts the well-conceived system of training, rest, relief and leave, and leaves both the commanders and other ranks tired and distressed. The deployment for elections sometimes reaches ludicrous levels, with these forces being summoned to even ensure the smooth functioning of   elections. Policymakers need to take a call to streamline these in order to ensure that these forces are able to retain their efficiency. They also need to strictly implement the recommendation of the group of ministers (appointed after the Kargil war) of â€œone force one roleâ€ so that these forces acquire domain expertise and adopt a cohesive operational and training philosophy. The infrastructure and amenities at the place of deployment even after so many years of existence of these forces are   not up-to required standard. The younger people joining the forces are well educated and exposed to modern technology and the modern way of life Thus, they have aspirations which the forces are not able to cater to. The basic reasons for this can be categorised into two parts. Similar is the situation in Jaisalmer and Bikaner sectors. If we canâ€™t provide even the basic necessities to troops, we cannot expect to retain them. It is said that a proposal to this effect is gathering dust in the corridors of power for the last four years. Policy makers urgently need to rectify the situation. The personnel have to stay away from their families with two months of earned leave and 15 days of casual leave available to them to visit their homes. A leave plan is religiously prepared at beginning of the year but can be rarely followed because of uncertainties of their duties. The scale of family accommodation available within the campuses is only 14 percent, and this too is curtailed by the fact that rapid expansion has compelled even the existing accommodation to be shared. This adversely affects morale, especially if troops are unable to be with their families in times of need. This deprives them of a normal family life leading to stress which sometimes manifests in acts of indiscipline and even fratricide. In case of officers, the situation is even worse. Some officers who joined BSF in the first decade would retire with just one promotion in their entire career. Efforts to rectify the situation through recently held (after a lapse of over 25 years) â€˜cadre reviewâ€™ has  succeeded in postponing stagnation. No wonder the young officers and subordinate officers are resigning in droves at the first available opportunity even if such opportunity is below the status and pay that they are in receipt of in these organisations. To add insult to injury, the higher level policy-making posts are not available to cadre officers who have deep insight of the work culture and ethos of the force. IPS leaders of these forces have neither any stake nor continuity to improve matters, as they come on deputation to avoid an uncomfortable situation in states or on the promise of a posting to New Delhi or their home town. Most importantly, the leadership of these forces must now be passed on to the cadre of officers of these forces so that their intricate knowledge of ethos of these forces can be utilised at policy making levels.

This is a part of that effort,"" said expelled Janata Dal-United leader Sharad Yadav said when asked if there will be a united front of opposition parties in 2019. Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Tejashwi Yadav remarked, Asked if there was a consensus on Rahul Gandhi's leadership of the probable opposition alliance, Tejashwi said, ""The time has not yet come to decide on the prime ministerial candidate."" Sonia Gandhi had earlier called for opposition unity, saying parties should set aside their minor differences to come together in the larger interest of keeping the BJP out of power. Congress communications incharge Randeep Surjewala said the dinner was not organised for politics, but for amity and friendship among opposition parties. He claimed at a time when the government was not allowing Parliament to function, it was obvious that leaders of various parties, who wanted to raise issues in national interest, would get together to discuss the current political situation. Surjewala also accused the government of running away from debates on key issues such as banking frauds. Though the Congress termed the dinner as a ""non-politicalâ€ event, it was loaded with political significance as it may set the tone for unity among the opposition parties to take on the BJP-led NDA in the 2019 general elections. A Left leader told PTI, â€œIt was a political dinner. But there were no political talks.

167,IANS,Maharashtra Govt to Withdraw Cases Against Bhima-Koregaon Rioters - The Quint,"The Maharashtra government plans to withdraw cases against the accused in the 1 January Bhima-Koregaon caste riots in Pune which had left one dead, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced in the Assembly on Tuesday, 13 March. He also said that the state government will give compensation to the people who suffered losses during the rioting. Fadnavis informed the house that a committee will be set up to take a decision on the serious cases filed in the matter and submit its report within three months. He also said that the state will take over the management and maintenance of the samadhi of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj in Vadhu-Budruk village, around five kms from Bhima-Koregaon. The riots had left one person dead and over a hundred injured including 60 policemen, he added. Referring to the losses, Fadnavis said these amounted to around Rs 13 crore, out of which Rs 9.40 crore were in Bhima-Koregaon riots itself. Of these, Dalit community members suffered losses of around Rs 1 crore and Muslims more than Rs 85 lakh, which the government would compensate, Fadnavis said. The disturbances erupted in the village of Bhima-Koregaon on 1 January during the 200th anniversary celebrations of the Anglo-Maratha War which saw the army of Peshwa Bajirao II being defeated by a small force of the East India Company that comprised a large number of Dalits. That afternoon, several lakhs of Dalits had congregated around the Victory Pillar (Vijay Stambh) erected by the British in Sanaswadi village when suddenly stone pelting started, allegedly by some right-wing groups carrying saffron flags. In the clashes that ensued between the two groups, more than 30 vehicles, including buses, police vans and private vehicles were torched or damaged and one youth, Rahul Fatangale, 28, of Nanded lost his life. The Bhima-Koregaon incident was followed by a crippling Maharashtra shutdown on 3 January, organised by the Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, led by Prakash Ambedkar, the grandson of the architect of Indian Constitution, BR Ambedkar. Tuesday's development is seen against the backdrop of Monday's massive response to the 200-km long Nashik-Mumbai Long March by over 35,000 farmers, tribals and labourers organised by the CPI-M affiliated All India Kisan Sabha, which proved a success with the government accepting most of their demands.

168,Anmol Saini,Naresh Agrawal Joins the League of Leaders That Defected to BJP - The Quint,": Purnendu Pritam On Monday, Naresh Agrawal, a former member of Samajwadi Party, who had been a staunch critic of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Narendra Modi government in the past decided to shake hands with the enemy. Agrawal joined the BJP in presence of Union minister Piyush Goyal. This trend of defection to the BJP among Opposition leaders is nothing new and has been pretty common post 2014, after Narendra Modi had a landslide win in the Lok Sabha polls. Since then, be it Opposition leaders of a regional party or ones with a national profile, during an election season, we see them join hands with the BJP. Hereâ€™s a list of some prominent leaders that joined hands with the BJP in the last three years: Once an MLA from the Congress ticket for 15 years in Assam, Himanta Biswa Sarma is now the face of the BJP in the Northeast. Sarma was a member of the Indian National Congress from 1996 to 2015 and when the party came to power in the state, he served as a minister in Tarun Gogoiâ€™s Cabinet. However, citing differences with the then Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, Sarma quit the party and joined the BJP. After BJP in an alliance with Asom Gana Parishad won the Assam Assembly election in 2016, he was awarded the portfolios of education, health and finance.

169,The Quint,CIAâ€™s First Woman Director Gina Haspelâ€™s Has a Questionable Past - The Quint,"US President Donald Trump Tuesday, 13 March, tweeted that he replaced US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, and appointed Gina Haspel as the new director of the CIA. With the announcement, Haspel has become the first woman to head the CIA. However, Haspelâ€™s past hints at a dark inhuman chapter in her career. Gina Haspel, 60, the former deputy director of the CIA, allegedly operated a ""black site"" prison in Thailand where suspects were waterboarded,   reported. The waterboarding footage of two suspected al-Qaida members â€“ Abu Zubaydah and Abd al Rahim al-Nashiri â€“ was allegedly later destroyed with the help of Haspel,   quoting US officials, who told Reuters and Associated Press, as saying. In 2016, Trump, in his first TV interview after taking charge, said that he was not against inhuman torture and that the US should ""fight fire with fire."" Haspel holds a three-decade long international career with several senior positions in Washington like the National Clandestine Service for Foreign Intelligence and Covert Action. She was a part of the top representative of the CIA in London. In an official statement, she said, â€œAfter 30 years as an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency, it has been my honor to serve as its deputy director alongside Mike Pompeo for the past year. â€œI am grateful to President Trump for the opportunity, and humbled by his confidence in me, to be nominated to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency,â€ she said.

171, KP Sanjeev Kumar,Chronicle of a Death Foretold: How to Plan For Your â€˜Last Flightâ€™ - The Quint,"I put before you two real-life examples that may whet your appetite for further reading on this gloomy topic. Chartered accountant Shilpa* married IT guy Suraj who hailed from the city of Bangalore. In terms of earning potential and tech savviness, both were at the forefront of their generation. Like thousands of DINK (â€˜double-income-no-kidsâ€™) couples in the city, they owned apartments, a car, bike â€“ all bought on loans â€“ and many bank accounts. Being a chartered accountant, Shilpa was extremely organised when it came to work, a virtue she didnâ€™t need to practice at home thanks to Suraj. They lived the life most of the nouveau rich couples of 21st century India are fortunate enough to enjoy. Shilpaâ€™s world came crashing down like a deck of cards. She also had absolutely no idea how many accounts they held in which banks, how bills were paid each month, what the mortgage on the house was and how it was paid, where their investments lay or how to access them. Nothing. Just a big zero. His accounts didnâ€™t have a nominee. His life insurance policy taken many years ago had his mother â€“ who had expired two years ago â€“ as the nominee. In her own words, â€œI couldnâ€™t even grieve in peace.â€  Amita was born into a poor family in a remote village in Maharashtra. Like many children from under-privileged families, she had to drop out of school at an early age and take up domestic work as a live-in maid servant in Mumbai. Her employers Sameer and Supriya were kind and looked after her every need, even getting her married when she turned 19, to Anil, a 21-year old â€˜decent fellowâ€™ with no vices who had a â€˜jobâ€™ in Pune. Anil was educated till Class X, and could read and write in both Marathi and English. Anil and Amita were married for ten years. Then one day, Anil, only 31 years old at the time, suffered a cardiac arrest and died. The contrast in Shilpa and Amitaâ€™s life situation couldnâ€™t have been starker. Every single asset and financial instrument in Anilâ€™s case was either co-owned by Amita or had her as the nominee. He left her with two apartments, one   (tenement), a four-wheeler and a bike â€“ all secured with loans that were insured so she didnâ€™t have to pay a dime after his demise. He had taken multiple-term insurance policies in his name that covered his wife, mother and sonâ€™s future needs. The â€˜documentation manâ€™ had left on his final journey like he was preparing for it every day he lived. Whatâ€™s more, he had quietly inducted Amitaâ€™s uneducated brother also into the business, thereby ensuring his financial freedom long after he was gone. Amita now lives with her son in her own 2-BHK apartment in a middle-class neighbourhood in Pune with complete financial security. Somewhere between these two extreme ends of the financial acuity spectrum, you can locate the narrative of your life. In most families I know, financial matters are completely outsourced to the man in the house even though the wife is highly educated or well-placed. To be fair, this is not just a situation specific to India.   husband was hit while riding his bicycle near Lake Washington, Seattle, needing expensive treatment that ultimately couldnâ€™t save his life. It was the same old story. A four-bedroom house bought on mortgage, meagre emergency funds and a number of accounts locked with passwords that went with her husband to the netherworld. Although they had a will prepared, it was not signed, which made it as good as a blank sheet of paper. She spent many months excavating the financial mess she had inherited. As a tribute to her husband and with the aim to help others who may end up in the same situation, she started a website, rather irreverently named  . It offers solutions to prepare for that phone call nobody wants. It may carry an American flavour but the basics remain the same. It has checklists, templates for wills and living wills, legal forms and estate plans. I recommend a casual visit to this website to shake yourself out of the illusion of immortality. Meanwhile, get your act together by sitting with your spouse, and work out answers to some of the issues below: Firstly, shake off that patriarchal mentality that finance is the sole purview of the male head of the family. Welcome to the 21st Century. Women can read maps and do numbers. Look around. They head some of Indiaâ€™s top banks. Christine Lagarde has been heading the World Bank for over seven years. Remember how, in olden times, the  was always tucked away, under the waist of the  What changed? Kaushal Dalal, the founder of  , says that in India, apart from buying a life insurance policy, not enough thought goes into planning for death. According to him, this could be part culture, part superstition as we believe that speaking or planning for something means it will happen  . But whether you like it or not, death will come for everyone. The courts are awash with property disputes. This happens when you die intestate, ie,   a will, when the wealth can find many claimants as per the laws of succession applicable under the deceasedâ€™s religion. Registering a will makes it more resilient to challenge but it is not mandatory. Apart from distributing the wealth as per your wishes, a will can also lay down responsibilities to look after your dependents. Just as a will outlines what you want done after your demise, a   specifies your wishes for medical care should you meet with an accident or illness that leaves you incapacitated and unable to express informed consent. It is also known as an â€˜advance healthcare directiveâ€™. It covers a number of conditions ranging from resuscitation guidelines to how long you would like to be kept on a ventilator or under dialysis. The   is still to decide on the bounds of a â€˜living willâ€™ and one hopes that the law will account for families who may be driven to financial ruin in keeping a family member alive when only a miracle can bring them back. Please consult a legal source for advice on writing your living will. Do you really need so many bank accounts? I have savings accounts in four banks and every time I change a log-in or transaction password, I get a headache. When itâ€™s time to file your tax returns, multiple accounts mean   more work. In most households, the spouse has another set of bank accounts. Some are linked to housing loans, some to vehicle loans, and some to pay insurance premiums and monthly bills. It can get very intimidating. Not surprisingly, most of us just leave it to one of the members â€“ usually a man â€“ to juggle half a dozen accounts. Imagine if you were to suddenly attain â€˜dear departedâ€™ status. Who will unravel the mystery for those left behind (like in Shilpaâ€™s case)? Here are some tips: If Anil had not insured his loans and indemnified Amita, she would have lost all their property to the banks and even parted with their savings (Refer to Case 2). In short, Anilâ€™s demise would have practically left her on the road. For a few rupees more, consider insuring your loans, especially if you are the sole breadwinner. Nobody has taken the elixir of immortality. When you go, donâ€™t leave those dependent on you under a mountain of debt. I have known people who have gone on a real estate buying frenzy on the strength of current earnings without a care how it will be paid for if the cash flow stops abruptly. Distress sales of property and bank takeovers soon follow. With the digitisation of banking and markets, documents and portfolios have been dematerialised and moved online. This brings us back to grappling with user IDs, passwords and the lot â€“ not everyoneâ€™s cup of tea. Again, our good friend during adversity is that old file with hard copies of all required documents, enabling at least a quick overview and access for both stakeholders. Unless you have better ideas, I would recommend full and complete access for the spouse written down in a way that she is comfortable. If you are lucky, very soon she will overtake you in handling the portfolio. In some homes, company secretaries manage the breadwinnerâ€™s accounts and investments while the oblivious better-half swipes plastic from a secondary account. To each his own. But remember, your spouse will be at the secretaryâ€™s mercy at a sad and critical juncture in life. I have seen wives and their in-laws fighting over insurance money within days of the funeral. Do you have an emergency fund lined up for that day when there is a sudden crisis in the family? It could be the loss of a job, a family member taking seriously ill, emergency travel or any unforeseen situation requiring a large payout. An emergency fund is not for planned expenses but acts as a safety net while your primary investments are safely compounding. How much that fund should hold depends on your money situation, liquidity and medical/disability cover etc. The thumb rule as per experts is 3-6 months household expenses. More importantly, it should be quickly accessible to both of you independently at any given time. This may sound bizarre but think about it. You couldnâ€™t plan your birth or first birthday but wonâ€™t you like to have a say in how you are bid goodbye? Here are some things you may like to consider (with due regard to specific religious beliefs and customs): â€¦ and so on. It would be a good idea to consult your spouse and family members before including these in your will. Having come so far, it is now time to prepare that master file. Let us review what all it needs to contain so that your spouse and executor of your will are able to smoothly and expeditiously transition the ownership of assets and discharge your will. If I missed out something, give me a shout and I shall add it to the list. Here goes: Benjamin Franklin said, â€œIn this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxesâ€. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley casting the tax net far and wide, you will likely be spending much time on taxes. Donâ€™t lose sight of the other event. Give them the privacy and financial freedom to grieve in peace and move on without having to wait outside banks and courts. Leave a legacy,   a mess. Make your â€˜master fileâ€™  .

172,Poonam Agarwal,"NiMo Case: ED Seizing Rs 6,300 Crore Assets Doesnâ€™t Mean Recovery - The Quint","On 15 February, hours after Indiaâ€™s largest bank scam â€“ where diamond czar Nirav Modi and his uncle, Mehul Choksi, allegedly got illegal loans of Rs 12,636 crore from the Punjab National Bank â€“ hit headlines, the Enforcement Directorate raided several of Modiâ€™s and Choksiâ€™s properties. The agency tweeted that Rs 5,100 crore worth of diamonds and precious stones had been seized â€“ or half the scam amount. But, does this seizure really mean that half the exchequerâ€™s money has been recovered from the diamond duo? Can the agency hand over the assets to PNB so that they can sell it and recover the money? NO. The ED has registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against Modi and Choksi. As per law, after the seizures are made by the agency, it has to produce the seizure before the Adjudicating Authority within a month. An Adjudicating Authority comprises three members â€“ one each from the field of law, administration, and finance or accountancy. It functions under the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Finance. If the Adjudicating Authority passes an order in favour of the ED, the accused person(s) can appeal in the Applellate Tribunal against the formerâ€™s order within 150 days. The ED can take the possession of the seizure/attachments if the Applellate Tribunal too passes the order in the agencyâ€™s favour. However, the ED cannot dispose off the seizure/attachment till the court convicts the accused persons. For instance, in the alleged 2G spectrum scam case, the ED attached assets of the accused persons worth several crore rupees during investigation in 2010. Since then, the ED was the custodian of all the attached assets. After seven years of a fast track court trail, all the accused in the alleged 2G scam were acquitted, which means the ED has to return the seized assets to their respective owners. However, if the CBI and ED appeal in the Delhi High Court and get a stay on the trail court order, then the agency will continue to be the custodian of the attached assets. This basically means it would be in the possession of agencies for several more years till the case is decided by the Supreme Court. The ED can dispose off the seizure/attachments after the accused are convicted by the apex court. The PMLA was passed in 2002. Here are the statistics of PMLA cases in the Enforcement Directorate. The ED has claimed to have seized assets worth over Rs 6,300 crore from different locations since the Modi-Choksi scam broke. The agency evaluated the worth of the assets based on the price mentioned in the ledger books seized from the offices and outlets of Modi and Choksi. However, this was not the final evaluation. Apart from the jewellery, the ED has, so far, also seized luxury cars, almirahs and watches from Modi and Choksiâ€™s properties. Interestingly, some of the watches cost as low as Rs 2,600. Maintenance and storage of the assets is the responsibility of the ED after it is seized. Hence, it incurs the extra cost. By the time Mallya's case is decided in the courts, one can only imagine what the price of these assets after depreciation would be. Similarly, in the Modi and Choksi case, the ED has seized high-end cars, including a Rolls Royce Ghost, two Mercedes Benz GL Class, and a Porsche Panamera, among others, whose current market value would be crores of rupees. However, years later if those are auctioned, it could be sold as just a lump of metal. In fact, the government would end up spending more money storing and maintaining the assets.

173,Vishnu Gopinath,Xi Jinping Ruling China â€˜Foreverâ€™ May Not Be So Bad. Or Is It? - The Quint,"On 11 March, 2,958 lawmakers of Chinaâ€™s legislature, the National Peopleâ€™s Congress, voted to approve a constitutional amendment abolishing the two-term limit on Presidency. The limit was put in place by leader Deng Xiaoping, in 1982, after Mao Zedongâ€™s â€œGreat Leap Forwardâ€ and â€œCultural Revolutionâ€, left millions dead. Chinaâ€™s move, however, hardly comes as a surprise to people who have kept an eye on Xiâ€™s rise to power. With that said, the worldwide commentary on Xi essentially locking the doors to power and keeping the only key with himself, has been split. Charlie Campbell, writes in   magazine, that Xi asserting a vice-like grip on the reins of power is reminiscent of the Mao Zedong era. While adding that China could justify the move for a â€œstable leader,â€ given Donald Trumpâ€™s ascent to Presidency, Campbell adds... Not too surprisingly, Chinese state-run daily   featured an opinion piece titled â€˜ â€™ highlighting the â€œneed for stronger Chinese governance.â€ The Chinese mouthpiece adds that the â€œweakeningâ€ of the United Statesâ€™ governance further justifies the revision of the clause placing the limit on Xiâ€™s tenure as President. Magazine paints a more optimistic picture of Xiâ€™s ascent to the throne, raising Chinaâ€™s economic initiatives, elaborating how businesses in the United States could benefit, in a commentary titled, â€˜ â€™ The BRI or One-Belt-One-Road(OBOR) initiative is likely to rejig the worldâ€™s economies, linking China more deeply with the world. Swaran Singh, Professor at JNU, however asks in an opinion piece in  whether the constitutional amendment has effectively focused too much power in one personâ€™s hands, something that Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had worked to avoid, by pushing for the two-year limit passed in 1982. Professor Singh goes on to highlight the fine details, which he says are the â€œreal cause of concern,â€ in the tale of Xiâ€™s rise. An article in   says that Xiâ€™s elevation as the possible permanent leader of China could   by providing â€œstability and clarityâ€. However, the article goes on to add that the near-permanent nature of Xiâ€™s Presidency could lead to an inclination to fall in line with Xiâ€™s policies, even at the cost of citizensâ€™ suffering.

176,AP,No Evidence of Trump-Putin Collusion In US Elections: House Panel,"Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee have completed a draft report concluding there was no collusion between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russiaâ€™s efforts to influence the vote. A finding that pleased the White House but enraged Democrats who had not yet seen the document. Conaway is the Republican leading the House probe, one of several investigations on Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. ""We found no evidence of collusion,"" Conaway told reporters, suggesting that those who believe there was collusion are reading too many spy novels. Hours later, Trump tweeted his own headline of the report in excited capital letters. Conaway previewed some of the conclusions, but said the public will not see the report until Democrats have reviewed it and the intelligence community has decided what information can become public, a process that could take weeks. Democrats are expected to issue a separate report with far different conclusions. In addition to the statement on coordination with Russians, the draft challenges an assessment made after the 2016 election that Russian meddling was an effort to help Trump. The January 2017 assessment revealed that the FBI, CIA and NSA had concluded that the Russian government, at the direction of President Vladimir Putin, waged a covert influence campaign to interfere in the election with the goal of hurting Democrat Hillary Clinton's candidacy and helping Trump's campaign. Conaway said there will be a second report just dealing with the intelligence assessment and its credibility. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a statement soon after the GOP announcement, saying it stood by the intelligence community's findings. DNI spokesman Brian Hale said the office will review the findings of the committee's report. According to Conaway, the report will agree with the intelligence assessment on most other details, including that Russians did meddle in the election. It will detail Russian cyberattacks on US institutions during the election and the use of social media to sow discord. It will also show a pattern of Russian attacks on European allies â€” information that could be redacted in the final report. And it will blame officials in President Barack Obama's administration for a ""lackluster"" response and look at leaks from the intelligence community to the media. It will include at least 25 recommendations, including how to improve election security, respond to cyberattacks and improve counterintelligence efforts. The Democrats and Republicans have openly fought throughout the investigation, with Democrats suggesting a cover-up for a Republican president and one GOP member of the panel calling the probe ""poison"" for the previously bipartisan panel. The top Democrat on the intelligence panel, California Rep. Adam Schiff, suggested that by wrapping up the probe the Republicans were protecting Trump. He called the development a ""tragic milestone"" and said history would judge them harshly. Republicans ""proved unwilling to subpoena documents like phone records, text messages, bank records and other key records so that we might determine the truth about the most significant attack on our democratic institutions in history,"" Schiff said. The report is also expected to turn the subject of collusion toward the Clinton campaign, saying an anti-Trump dossier compiled by a former British spy and paid for by Democrats was one way that Russians tried to influence the election. Conaway did not suggest that Clinton knowingly coordinated with the Russians, but said the dossier clearly ""would have hurt him and helped her."" He also said there was no evidence that anything ""untoward"" happened at a June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower between members of the Trump campaign and Russians, though he called it ill-advised. Despite a promise of dirt on Clinton ahead of the meeting, there's no evidence that such material was exchanged, he said. The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is also investigating the Russian intervention, is expected to have a bipartisan report out in the coming weeks dealing with election security. The Senate panel is expected to issue findings on the more controversial issue of coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia at a later date. The Senate Judiciary Committee, also investigating the meddling, is expected to release transcripts soon of closed-door interviews with several people who attended the 2016 meeting between the Trump campaign and Russians. It's unclear if the Judiciary panel will produce a final report. The congressional investigations are completely separate from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe, which is likely to take much longer. It has already resulted in charges against several people linked to Trump's campaign. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political
177,Akanshya Shah,Nepal and Pakistanâ€™s Budding Friendship Should Concern India - The Quint,"Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi paid a two-day official visit to Nepal from 4-5 March to congratulate his counterpart KP Sharma Oli for his recent appointment as the new PM of Nepal after the historic provincial and state elections. This was the first official visit by a Pakistani PM to Nepal after a gap of 24 years. In 1994, the then PM Benazir Bhutto had travelled to Kathmandu on a bilateral visit. Nawaz Sharif visited Nepal to attend the 18th SAARC Summit in 2014. Oli, on his part, extended a warm welcome to Abbasi, who was accorded the Guard of Honour at the Army Pavilion at Tundikhel ground at the heart of the capital city â€” against the traditional practice of extending such an honour to visiting dignitaries at Tribhuwan International Airport in Kathmandu. In his meeting with Oli, Abbasi shared progress made with regard to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is being taken up under the BRI in which Pakistan is building huge infrastructure, such as roads, railways, ports, airports and grids. Reportedly, Abbasi expressed happiness over Nepal joining the BRI, which he said is â€œa game changer for the whole of South Asiaâ€, and suggested that Nepal could use the Gwadar Port in Balochistan province of Pakistan through Kerung-Tibet main railway line. Nepal joined the BRI in May 2017 when Maoist Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda was the PM, although not much progress has been made in identifying and implementing the projects under BRI. Besides, Abbasi expressed the need to expedite the SAARC process, which has been stalled given the India-Pakistan rivalry mainly over Kashmiri militancy. The 19th SAARC Summit, scheduled to be held in Islamabad in November 2016, was cancelled after India decided to boycott it citing Pakistanâ€™s involvement in the Uri terror attack. Terrorism figured prominently during the bilateral talks. Abbasi pointed out that Pakistan is facing isolation with regard to international terrorism, but the country is equally affected by the scourge of terror activities. While India consistently said that the blockade was caused by the agitating groups on the Nepal side, the nationalist forces in Nepal believed it to be a form direct pressure from India, on the then Oli government, to give in to the Madhesi demands to reform the new constitution. Given the unprecedented hardship faced by the Nepalese people during the blockade that lasted for five months, there was a surge of anti-India sentiment in Nepal. The public voting in the last polls in Nepal in favor of the communist parties have already compelled India to initiate dialogue with the new establishment in Kathmandu. But there are no clear indications yet. Oli is said to be close to China. With Nepal coming closer to Pakistan, an all-weather ally of China, India may be faced with a tough dilemma in its dealings with the Oli government. China has made strong in-roads into Nepal within a short span of time. With its direct involvement in the political affairs of Nepal now, China has emerged as a strong alternative partner for Nepalâ€™s overall development. Abbasiâ€™s visit is thus, significant in two ways. First, it shows the keen desire of both Pakistan and China to develop close linkages with Nepal to negate Indian influence there. It is to be noted that Abbasi did not meet Opposition leaders of Nepali Congress and even former PM Baburam Bhattarai of Naya Shkati, both of whom are considered close to India. The US and India want to partner up to build road connectivity in the Indo-Pacific region, as a kind of an alternative to the Chinese One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative. Such an initiative will invariably include Japan and Australia as well. This has met with resistance from China. On the other hand, the US has put increasing pressure on Pakistan, even threatening to cut down military assistance, and to crack down on terrorist safe havens on its territory. Pakistan may face isolation, as suggested by Abbasi in Kathmandu, and is thus, keen on seeking friendly ties with other South Asian countries with help from China. Second, if Kathmandu cozies up to Pakistan (and therefore China), India may face tough competition to maintain a strategic space in Nepal, which it considers as its traditional sphere of influence. It will be highly difficult for India to stop Chinese rise or contain it in a manner that will give more strategic advantage to it. China will continue supporting Nepalâ€™s development endeavours based on its capacity and expect to become a key stakeholder in the Himalayan country. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

He has submitted his resignation letter in the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) and sent a copy to the lieutenant governor, the source added. Jain was appointed to the post in September, last year, days after he had retired as the CEO of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB). The board is chaired by Kejriwal. Jain had not been coming to the CMO since the incident and had gone on a week-long medical leave, the sources said. Prakash was allegedly assaulted by AAP MLAs during a meeting at the chief minister's residence in the evening of 19 February. The alleged assault on Prakash took place in the presence of Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia. In solidarity with Prakash, IAS and Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Services (DCS) officers have not been attending meetings with AAP ministers, and only maintaining written communication with them. The joint forum of the Delhi government employees has demanded action against Kejriwal and Sisodia in connection with the case. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

179,The Quint,SP Leader Naresh Agrawal Joins BJP," Vivek Gupta Newly inducted Bharatiya Janata Party leader Naresh Agrawal expressed his regrets about the remarks he made about â€œdancers and film actors were preferred over [him] for the nominations for the Upper House of Parliamentâ€, a day after he joined the party. â€œI apologise if anybodyâ€™s sentiments have been hurt by my remarkâ€, he told reporters on Tuesday, 13 March. The remarks, made in the presence of Union Minister Piyush Goyal at the party headquarters in Delhi, referred to the nomination of actor Jaya Bachchan by the Samajwadi Party for a Rajya Sabha seat from Uttar Pradesh, ignoring Agrawalâ€™s claim. Agrawal's term as Rajya Sabha member is ending on 2 April, reported PTI. The BJP, meanwhile, was left red-faced, as it sought to distance itself from Agrawalâ€™s remarks. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj welcomed Agrawal into the BJP, but called his comments regarding Jaya Bachchan â€œimproper and unacceptableâ€. Meanwhile, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said his party respects people from all fields and welcomed them in politics. Agrawal also announced that his son Nitin, who is an SP MLA, will be joining the BJP and will vote for the BJP in the Rajya Sabha. Thanking PM Modi and Amit Shah for showing faith in him, he described his joining the BJP as a â€œhomecomingâ€. He also asserted that he has been influenced by both the Prime Minister as well as UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, adding that the whole nation is with Narendra Modi and his government. At the same time, Agrawal expressed his affection for SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his cousin Ram Gopal Yadav, but said the party's strength in Uttar Pradesh has depleted. Notably, Agrawal had been one of the most vocal critics of the Modi government and the BJP in the Rajya Sabha in the last few years. He is also no stranger to controversies, with his remarks in the House mocking Hindu gods sparking an uproar last year. Watch the entire press conference below: With Naresh Agrawal's induction into the BJP, many on Twitter pointed out that he had earlier been insulted by the very party and those sympathetic to the RSS. Sambit Patra had apparently tweeted against Agrawal earlier, but has now deleted it. Meanwhile, others questioned the BJPâ€™s decision to induct a leader who has allegedly made many controversial remarks in the past. (What does the first-time woman voter want?

180,The Quint,A List of Controversial Remarks Made by BJPâ€™s Naresh Agrawal,"Former Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Naresh Agrawal marked his entry into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with a controversy, as he said, ""Dancers and film actors were preferred over (him) for the nominations for the Upper House of Parliament"". The remarks, made at the BJP headquarters in Delhi, referred to the nomination of actor Jaya Bachchan by the SP for a Rajya Sabha seat from Uttar Pradesh, ignoring Agrawal's claim. But as it turns out, Agrawal is no stranger to controversy, having made bizarre statements all too often. What is even more interesting is that many of his controversial remarks have been made against Narendra Modi and the BJP, of which he is now a part. So here's a list of the many controversial utterances made by Naresh Agrawal over the course of his political career. Just a month before he joined the BJP, Naresh Agrawal, during an event organised by traders, referred PM Modi as ""Teli"". At the programme in Lucknow, a person while raising concerns related to the business community mentioned that both Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah belonged to the same section of the society. Later, speaking to reporters after the programme, Agrawal even seemed to defend his comments. As if the casteist slur was not enough, Agrawal even mocked Modi for being a tea-seller back in 2013. In a public meeting, Agrawal had said that Modi aspired to be PM, but someone rising from a tea shop can never have a national perspective. However, he later claimed that the media had distorted his comments and presented them out of context. Meanwhile, Modi had reacted to the statement saying: Agrawal attracted the ire of the BJP-led government when he made comments about Hindu gods in what was reportedly a mocking manner in July 2017, during a discussion on lynching in the Rajya Sabha. The uproar in the Upper House of the Parliament eventually made Agrawal express regret over his remark. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley slammed his comments, after he was quoted as saying: In December 2017, after the controversy over Kulbhushan Jadhav's meeting with his wife and mother in Pakistan, Naresh Agrawal had said, â€œIf Pakistan has considered Kulbhushan Jadhav to be a terrorist in their country, then they will treat him accordingly. In our country too, the terrorists should be treated in a similar manner. They should be treated with strictness.â€ The remarks invited condemnation from BJP leaders. At the time when the Triple Talaq bill was being tabled in the Rajya Sabha in early January 2018, Naresh Agrawal said that the BJP wants to make the issue a political one, adding that the BJP cannot talk about women's empowerment. When asked about the presence of Muslim women in the Parliament, he said, ""What is the guarantee that they were Muslims. Did you see? It may be that they are members of BJP's Mahila Morcha."" In 2013, Naresh Agrawal reportedly poked fun at the BJP for asking secular parties to ally with it. He was  as saying, ""In my village, there is a saying that if you ask a **** for blessings, she will ask you to become like her. Similarly, the BJP is asking everyone to become like them.""

181,PTI,"PM Modi to Inaugurate Science Congress, Dalai Lama to Skip it - The Quint","Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama will not attend the Indian Science Congress which opens in Manipur later this week, a conference organiser said on Monday, 12 March. The Nobel Laureate's decision not to attend the congress assumes significance in view of the cancellation of a recent event here where the Dalai Lama was expected to be present. The event, which was slated to have been held at Rajghat to commemorate the Buddhist monk's 60th year in exile in India, was later moved to Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh, and will now be held at the end of the month. The Indian Science Congress is an annual science event inaugurated by the prime minister. The general president of the Indian Science Congress Association (INSA), Achyuta Samanta, said the Tibetan leader had been invited to the conference, but said he would not be able to attend it. ""We were also told that he had visited Manipur two months ago,"" Samanta said. The Indian Science Congress website, however, still lists the Dalai Lama as one of the chief guests among other Nobel laureates expected to be present. The development also comes in the backdrop of a media report about an Indian government directive to senior functionaries at the Centre and in the states to skip events being organised by Tibetans. Earlier this month,   had reported that following a communication by Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale, Cabinet Secretary PK Sinha had sent out a note to senior functionaries of the Central and state governments asking them to avoid events being organised by Tibetans. Following the report, the Ministry of External Affairs had said the Dalai Lama was a revered religious leader and deeply respected by the people of India, and added that there was no change in that position. ""Government of India's position on His Holiness the Dalai Lama is clear and consistent. He is a revered religious leader and is deeply respected by the people of India. There is no change in that position,"" MEA Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political
182,The Quint,CBI Opposes Dawood Aide Farooq Taklaâ€™s Plea for Legal Counsel - The Quint,"The CBI counsel on Monday opposed the applications filed by the advocate of Farooq Takla, who is an aide of mafia don Dawood Ibrahim and also one of the accused in the 1993 Mumbai blasts. As reported by  , the applications sought legal counsel and to not make a confessional statement. Takla has been remanded to police custody till 19 March by a special TADA court after being brought to Mumbai early 8 March. Dawoodâ€™s aide Farooq Takla was brought to Mumbai in the early hours of 8 March to face the special TADA Court for his involvement in the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts case. Takla was brought to Mumbai after being deported from Dubai. Farooq Takla was produced before the special court constituted under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, in Mumbai, the CBI confirmed to  . Takla is likely to be tried for conspiracy, murder, and terrorism charges in the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case.  reported that National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval was believed to have played an important role in ensuring Takla's return to India. Takla was an accused in the blasts trial, along with gangster Dawood Ibrahim and a number of his other associates. Farooq Takla had reportedly fled from India after the 1993 Mumbai serial bomb blasts. Interpol had issued a Red Corner Notice against Takla in 1995, for his involvement in the 1993 bomb blasts. Takla had fled the country in 1995, along with Dawood Ibrahim, Tiger Memon, Chota Shakeel, and other important members of the underworld organisation dubbed the â€˜D-Companyâ€™,  added. Takla was brought back to India at 4.45 am on 8 March, Thursday,  reported. Public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said in a statement to ANI, that Farooq Takla being brought back to India, was a â€œhuge success,â€ adding that Takla was involved in the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, and that Takla has links which could be traced back to Dubai. Nikamâ€™s statements come on the tail of CNN News-18â€™s report that Takla was the one managing Dawood Ibrahimâ€™s operations in Dubai and the Middle East. Adding to Nikamâ€™s statement, NCP leader and senior criminal lawyer Majeed Memon speculated that Farooq Taklaâ€™s return to India, â€œ shows he has expressed his willingness to come back for trial.â€ Memon added that there was no question of Takla being granted bail while being questioned CBI or while awaiting trial by the special TADA Court. Section (8) of the original Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act prohibits the grant of bail to anyone accused of an offence under the act, save for two exceptions: That the Public Prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for release on bail. Where the Public Prosecutor opposes the application, but the Court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. As many as 27 others accused in the Mumbai blasts, including Ibrahim Kaskar and Tiger Memon, who are alleged to have been the brains behind the blasts, are still absconding from the grips of the Indian judiciary. The special TADA court had convicted two of the accused, Mohammed Taher Merchant, and Feroze Abdul Rashid Khan, in September 2017, giving them the death sentence. The men were tried and found guilty on charges including murder, waging war against the country, supplying arms and ammunition, and hatching a criminal conspiracy. While all six accused had been found guilty by the special TADA court in June 2017, one of the convicts, Mustafa Dossa, died of a heart attack on 28 June 2017. The CBI on Monday, 12 March opposed the applications put forth by Taklaâ€™s advocate Farhana Shah, which requested for a legal counsel being provided to him and to not make a confessional statement. According to  , the prosecution on behalf of the CBI, stated that the accused could not claim the right to maintain absolute silence and prevent criminal investigation of the crime. It filed its reply before the special TADA court. CBI counsel Deepak Salvi also said that having a legal counsel meet the accused, Takla, while he was still in CBI custody, would â€˜disrupt the investigationsâ€™, the report adds. However, Shah responded to this by saying: She also cited the example of Taher Merchant, another accused in the 1993 case, saying that the CBI had then approved his application to meet with his legal counsel twice, for 15 minutes, while he was still in custody. Additionally, the report states, Shah had also referred to the provision of allowing home-cooked food for Takla while he was still in custody, in her application. The court is expected to make a decision on the applications filed by Shah for Takla, on Tuesday. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you.

183,Ashutosh,â€˜CPMâ€™s Refusal to Change With Time is Making Left Weakerâ€™ - The Quint,"There should be no shame in losing power after 25 years in government but CPMâ€™s defeat in Tripura is being treated as death blow to Left parties in India. More than the CPMâ€™s defeat, it is the Bharatiya Janata Partyâ€™s (BJP) victory in Tripura that is surprising and historic. In the previous elections, the BJP had gotten merely 1.5 percent of the votes, and this time it is going to form the government with two-thirds majority. This marvel should be commended. While this is proof of the BJPâ€™s organisational strength, it is also testament to the fact that Narendra Modi and Amit Shahâ€™s hunger for victory is unmatched in Indian politics today. Whether they will be able to repeat this miracle in 2019 or not is a million-dollar question. But for me, the bigger question right now is whether the Leftâ€™s defeat in Tripura has sounded the death knell for its ideology in India. When I started working as a journalist after completing my studies at JNU, my editors assumed that I must be a communist, and assigned me as a reporter to cover the Left parties. The truth was that during my time in JNU, I was a strong opponent of communism, especially the CPM. But since I was assigned the beat, I started covering the Left. And I can say that it gave me an opportunity to see communism closely. Certain incidents in the recent past are proof of the fact that a party or organisation that does not evolve with time falls victim to it. There was a time when the world was divided into two blocks. One side was of the proletariat, of communism, and the other side was capitalist. Both were out to eradicate each other. They were mortal enemies. In 1990, the world changed. Suddenly, the communist forts collapsed. The bastion of communism, the Soviet Union, was wiped out from the world map, and the countries that emerged in its wake had nothing to do with communism. The other powerful communist nation, China decided that after the death of Mao Tse Tung, they needed to move forward on the path of development and success, even if that meant going through the capitalist route. That is, on a ideological level communism wasnâ€™t a â€œgolden dreamâ€ anymore. And when the dream of an ideology dies, that ideology itself also eventually gets consigned to dust. In India, the Left remained stuck and refused to evolve. It is true that at one time, in the Indian context, the Left did change itself. They left the path of a communist revolution and adopted democracy; they set aside the struggle of the proletariat and took up parliamentary traditions. As a result, they gained a stronghold in three states, and on an ideological level, influenced the Indian psyche across the board. But today, they are growing weaker by the day in Bengal and any hopes of resurrection are fading out. In the past 20 years, the CPM has made two stupid mistakes. First was in 1996, when the United Front wanted to make West Bengal Chief Minister Jyoti Basu prime minister, and Basu himself wanted to be PM. Party general secretary Harikrishan Singh Surjeet also supported the idea, but under the leadership of Prakash Karat the party rejected the proposal. After the first rejection, the United Front asked the party to reconsider but the proposal was rejected yet again. Much later, in an interview, Basu admitted that this was the partyâ€™s biggest mistake. At the time, the CPI had just joined the government. Indrajit Gupta, who was the general secretary of the party, became home minister and the partyâ€™s other big leader, Chaturanan Mishra, became agriculture minister. The CPM decided to support the government from the outside. In 2004, when the Congress-led coalition came to power after the BJPâ€™s unexpected defeat, the CPM had 63 MPs. They once again strongly supported the Manmohan Singh government. The Left accent on the government was going well till the issue of the nuclear deal with the USA came up. The CPM then unsettled the fairly stable government and withdrew its support. In 1996, they didnâ€™t join the government but strongly stood by it. In 2008, the country saw how the CPM destabilised the government over a minor issue. This mistake proved fatal for the CPM. The biggest affect this had was in Bengal where Mamata Banerjee ousted them. The generation of Jyoti Basu, EMS Namboodiripad, and Harkishan Surjeet had flexiblity, and based on that, they would adjust the ideology as per the situation. But as soon as Karat and Yechury became powerful in the party, the party got confined in the annals of ideology. In Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharya wanted to use capitalism after becoming the chief minister; he wanted to open up the markets further, wanted to call in big industrialists for industrialisation, but the party didnâ€™t let him do it. Somnath Chatterjee was well respected in Parliament. If he had remained Speaker, the party wouldnâ€™t have lost anything. Then in 2009, the country rejected the CPM. The Congressâ€™ seats increased. Even today, the CPM is suffering from the same stupidity. Let me give two examples: One, Yechury is a great orator. His presence in Parliament adds to its stateliness; he adds strength to the Opposition. The CPM has a rule that no leader can be an MP in Rajya Sabha for more than two consecutive terms, so the party refused to nominate him for a third term. Right now, the Parliament really needs people like Yechury. Two, sectarianism is spreading across the country. The threat of fascism is looming large. In times like these, it is important that secular forces come together, but the CPM has refused to reach any kind of compromise with the Congress. According to them, the BJP and the Congress are similar forces. Here, it is important to remember that in 1989, when the winds were blowing against the Congress because of the Bofors scandal, the same CPM had reached an understanding with the BJP. VP Singhâ€™s government had the BJP support on one end and the Left support on the other. Today, there is a major threat to the country. The Modi government and the RSS are working hard to clear out communist ideology from the country. Whether it is JNU or Jadavpur University, there are efforts to label it anti-national. The RSS belives that until communists are not eradicated from the country, its own Hindutva ideology wonâ€™t be able to hold much sway over the countryâ€™s thinking. Hence the danger isnâ€™t just to secularism. The danger is to communism as well â€“ on both the political and the ideological levels. They need to understand that this fight is the most important fight since independence. They will have to let go of old Cold War grudges. Capitalism has won the fight over markets. Indian communists need to realise this. In societal analysis, words like bourgeoisie and proletariat have lost their meaning. Today, their fight is with forces that are unparalleled in their organisational capacity. They have immeasurable amounts of money. Their leadership is in the hands of people who know no mercy and can do anything to win. This can be combated only with extraordinary thinking and a capacity to adapt. Otherwise, the Left should get ready to read its obituary. (     (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political

The Chief Minister sent a letter to Governor NN Vohra informing that she had decided to remove Drabu, sources close to Mehbooba Mufti told IANS. The Peoples Democratic Party had on 11 March asked Drabu to explain his position since the statement he made, at an event organised by the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry in New Delhi on 9 March, was a negation of the stated position of the party. Both mainstream and separatist parties had criticised the PDP for Drabua's remarks asserting that the statement was proof of the ""political sellout made by the party to remain in power"". The PDP, however, on 11 March said that it recognises the state as a political issue and ever since its advent the party has relentlessly been pursuing its resolution through reconciliation and dialogue, both at internal and external levels.

188,The News Minute,BBMP Fake Bill Scam: CID Chargesheets Cong MLA Munirathna Naidu - The Quint,"In another embarrassment for the ruling Congress party ahead of the Karnataka Assembly polls, Rajarajeshwari Nagar MLA N Munirathna Naidu â€“ also a film producer and a civil contractor â€“ has been named as an accused in the Crime Investigation Department chargesheet for a multi-crore scam. According to  , the CID in its latest chargesheet in the Rs 1,500 crore Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike fake bill scam has named him as the fourth accused, seven years into the investigation. He has been named under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, forgery, falsification of accounts and also sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The case deals with fake bills submitted to the tune of Rs 1,500 crore â€“ purportedly the biggest scam to rock the BBMP â€“ relating to 285 civil works in RR Nagar, Malleswaram and Gandhinagar Assembly constituencies of during the years 2008 and 2011.

Recently, in May 2017, three female corporators, including one from his own party, threatened suicide alleging sexual assault by him and his aides. He was also indicted in a case involving the death of a minor due to a wall collapse in Government Veterinary College on Ballari Road. He was the contractor who built the wall. Other than Munirathna, three BBMP officials have been named as the other accused in the case. All four accused are out on bail. Defending himself once news of the chargesheet broke, Munirathna claimed that this was a BJP ploy ahead of the elections and said he will approach the Karnataka High Court for relief. He added that the CID did not ask for an explanation from him, even though he was given a clean chit by the BBMP in the past. He said although he owned the house, it was rented to an unrelated person. This move to name him comes just ahead of the polls in Karnataka. The Congress has been hit by a series of allegations â€“ a minister was caught on camera threatening to set a BBMP office on fire a few weeks ago and senior leader NA Harisâ€™ son was accused of brutally assaulting a man in an upscale eatery in Bengaluru last month. A lawyer involved in the Lokayukta case alleged that it was unnecessarily going soft on the MLA. â€œMunirathna is a repeat offender. When he was contractor, his shoddy work led to the death of a techie. Then, as Councillor, he indulged in corruption which has resulted in this chargesheet against him. And as MLA, he has been harassing women councillors. He has got away with all his malpractices and corruption thanks to CM Siddaramaiah. Finally the law has caught up with him,â€ BJP's Malavika Avinash said. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political

196,Ben Blanchard,"China Clears the Decks for Xi, Removes Presidential Term Limits","China removed presidential term limits from its constitution on Sunday, giving President Xi Jinping the right to remain in office indefinitely, and confirming his status as the country's most powerful leader since Mao Zedong died more than 40 years ago. China's ruling Communist Party announced the proposed amendment only last month, and there was never any doubt it would pass as parliament is packed with loyal party members who would not have opposed the proposal. The amendments also include inserting Xi's political theory into the constitution, something that was already added to the party charter in October at the end of a party congress, a feat no other leader since Mao had managed while in office. Additionally, clauses were included to give a legal framework to a new super anti-corruption department. Only two no votes were cast, with three abstentions, from almost 3,000 delegates. Xi cast his vote first, on the podium at the front of the hall, followed in turn by the other six members of the party's elite Standing Committee, which runs China. The room erupted into loud applause when the result of the vote was passed, though Xi did not address the parliament. Xi, 64, swiftly consolidated power after taking over as party chief in late 2012, and the move to lift the presidential term limits is not unexpected. In the run up to the vote, critics on Chinese social media attacked the move and drew parallels to North Korea or suggested a Mao Zedong-type cult of personality was forming. But the government quickly mounted a propaganda push, blocking some comments and publishing pieces praising the proposal. The party loyalists who attend the annual session of parliament have said the decision is popular with ordinary Chinese people and asserted that China was lucky to have a leader of Xi's calibre. He Guangliang from the poor southwestern province of Guizhou said it wasn't fair to draw comparisons with North Korea. ""China has its own national characteristics,"" He said. ""There's no one system that suits all countries."" However, the question was too sensitive for several legislators, who scurried away when asked about Xi being in office forever. He cast his vote right after the seven members of the Standing Committee. The amendment also lifts term limits for the vice presidency. ""We've not got around to discussing that yet,"" Chen Yunying, a senior defector from self-ruled Taiwan who is married to Justin Yifu Lin, the World Bank's former chief economist. ""We'll get it in the next few days,"" she told Reuters, referring to the candidate list for vice president, and adding, ""everyone has been saying"" it will be Wang for the position. Xi began his second five-year term as party chief in October, and at the end of the week, he will be formally appointed by parliament to his second term as president. The government has said lifting the term limits is about protecting the authority of the party with Xi at its centre. The party's official People's Daily has said this does not mean life-long terms. The party gave Xi the title of ""core"" leader in 2016, a significant strengthening of his position at the time. While the presidency is important, Xi's positions as head of the party and head of the military are considered more important, and these titles are always given first by state media. With the passage of the amendment, now none of the posts have formal term limits. (What does the first-time woman voter want? The Quint's   campaign is telling you. ",quint,left,political

Sources said there was a communication from the French government recently indicating its eagerness in making an announcement by the two sides favouring additional procurement of Rafale jets for the Indian Air Force. They said the issue of Rafale deal figured in the talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Macron. India had signed a government-to-government deal with France in 2016 to buy 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of about the Rs 58,000 crore. The Congress has been demanding details of the deal, alleging that the deal negotiated under its rule was much cheaper than the contract signed by the Modi government.

The Indian side conveyed that no decision has been taken yet on the issue. The Indian Air Force has also been favouring procurement of more Rafale jets from France. It had communicated to India earlier too, seeking additional orders of Rafale jets.

199,Arun Dev,The Forgotten Political Murder That Shaped The Future of Bhatkal ,"The surname Bhatkal is now a liability for many. For years, the name Bhatkal has been associated more often with two infamous terrorists than the town that bears the name. Itâ€™s a terror tag that this coastal Karnataka town finds hard to shed, almost as if the entire town is suspect. But a few decades ago, Bhatkal was an inconspicuous, Muslim-majority fishing town, which stayed peaceful even after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. The roots of the townâ€™s terror links come from its often-ignored political history. A turf war between the Sangh Parivar and Muslim organisations for political control that changed the face of the town. The murder of a popular RSS leader, who was the first MLA to be assassinated while in office, changed the townâ€™s political climate. This one crime eventually led to the creation of terrorists like Yasin and Riyaz; and the rise of far-right Hindu leaders like Anant Kumar Hegde. For years, only Muslim candidates were elected from the Bhatkal constituency and the presence of Hindu right-wing organisations was limited. As part of their attempts to establish their presence, the RSS decided to send a full time Karyakartha to the town. The candidate chosen for the task was a doctor from the Dakshin Kannada district â€“ Dr U Chittaranjan. Although an RSS man, Chittaranjan became popular in Bhatkal because of his service as a doctor. â€œMore than political activities, he used his profession to win over people in the town. Be it Muslims or Hindus, he used to charge less than Rs 5 for consultancy. This made him popular,â€ said Radhakrishnan, a senior journalist from Bhatkal. Chittarajanâ€™s popularity soon laid the strong foundations of the RSS and the BJP in Bhatkal. Junior leaders like Anant Kumar Hegde soon joined the newly-formed Hindu movement in the town. However, despite his popularity, he lost the elections twice. The Nawayaths, once a prominent sect of the Muslim community in Bhatkal. A business community, the Nawayaths speak the Nawaity language, which is very close to Persian. As members of the community migrated to the Gulf, their financial status improved. But this led to a financial disparity between Hindus and Muslims, and became the grounds for communal friction. Though the town saw no violence after the Babri Masjid demolition, the distance between the communities did widen. Things spiralled out of control when stones were pelted at the chariot procession at the famous Hanuman temple in the heart of Bhatkal. As a result, in 1993, the town saw communal violence for over 9 months. 19 people were killed in riots â€“ 10 Muslims and 9 Hindus. Many residential areas were attacked during these riots and religious ghettos formed as a result. In the aftermath of the riots, the BJP, led by Chittaranjan, came to power in Bhatkal in 1994. Even after winning the elections amidst communal tensions, Chittaranjan kept working for both communities. But things took a shocking turn 2 years later. GU Bhat, a senior journalist from the region, vividly remembers 10 April 1996, the day Chittranjan was assassinated. On reaching home that night, Chittranajan was waiting for dinner and as always, he had tuned in for the 8 pm news. The bullet went through his head, killing him instantaneously. His body was found in the middle of the room, in a pool of blood, while the bullet was found in the wall on the other side. The investigation was soon handed over to the CBI, but even after 8 different teams investigated the case, his murder remained a mystery. The investigation could not even conclusively ascertain whether the murder was carried out by Muslim groups or Hindu â€“ some investigators found that the use of a foreign bullet suggested a Muslim hand, while others found the timing suggestive of a Hindu hand using the death to galvanise the organisation. Chittaranjan was the first MLA to be assassinated while in office, and it created a sympathy wave for right-wing parties across coastal Karnataka. Anant Kumar Hegde, then a junior RSS leader who lived in the Chittaranjanâ€™s house, emerged as the new face of Hindutva. But unlike Chittaranjan, Hegde believed in polarising the communities for electoral gain. Within two months, Hegde was elected as MP from Uttara Kannada district in 1996, and his political clout has remained undisputed ever since. The murder also resulted in a political movement by the right-wing parties against the â€˜terror activities of the Muslimsâ€™, which ensured a violent polarisation of Bhatkal and the region. As the Hindutva movement gained traction and power in Bhatkal, youth employed in Gulf countries became the backbone of the Muslim resistance. A senior intelligence officer pointed out that the localised conflict soon saw the influence of international players, who tried to support the Muslim resistance against the rise of Hindutva. A Muslim doctor and community leader from Bhatkal said: Ahead of the 2018 Assembly Elections, the BJP is confident of winning from this coastal town. Even though Bhatkal town has a large Muslim population, the Bhatkal Assembly constituency has 60:40 (Hindu:Muslim) voters. The death of Hindu activist, Paresh Mesta, who was killed in the nearby town of Honnavar, is the latest trump card for BJP to keep the voters polarised in the area. As the Jana Surakha Yatre led by Anant Kumar Hegde reached Bhatkal on 5 March, they ensured that BJP conducted a show of strength, with over 1,000 BJP workers marching through its Muslim ghettos. Despite a literacy rate of over 90%, the polarisation that began in the mid 90s continues to dictate elections in this part of Karnataka. The political history of Bhatkal has been lost in the narrative of terrorism shrouding the town, but the BJP continues to reap the benefits of the polarisation that followed Chittaranjanâ€™s death.
